 Why do you want to go? Why do you want to go? Why do you want to go? Why do you want to go? Why do you want to go? Hey welcome to Watercooler. Thank you so, so much for tuning in and hanging out with us. Once again, you know how the show goes. I Chris locks him on a kick it with my Corolla Digital Buds of Yesterday Year. We've been here today all the way in Austin, TX. It's Mr. Matt Fondalier. Hey brother. And then all the way along Beach California like myself. It's Cayland Bean. It's going on. I can't. Hey Chris. And not much is going on except you know I'm getting the pot with my good buds. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And all the way in Orange County, California. It's Gary Smith. And he's going to be like, You know, I think Orange County's getting very close to claiming that saying the way Gary is evolving each time. So you better tell your Texas buddies to step it up Matt. Go send the message out now. We'll wait. Alright, he's gone. And then back, making his triumphant turn all the way and he's back in Noho. California. That's right. Mr. Mike Dawson. Yeah, I noticed how you incorporated a little bit of a hand drive into your mouth licks there. Chris. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Stopped it up a bit. You know, I did listen to the shows three times each course. And the movie. But I didn't do the video. Oh. So this time I don't know if that's something new. It's fresh, exciting. It's so inviting to me. Yeah. Yeah, you know how. What does it synth the seizure synth easier? What does it call when you see anesthesia? Anastasia. Anastasia. I just get super numb when I hear music. And I can't. Yeah, my body just just goes completely crazy because I can't. I have no feeling in my nerves. Maths right. It's anesthesia. Yeah. And that's what happens when I hear music. And when I feel the music. It's just I can't really numb. It's like someone just shot up a bunch of novocaine into all of my nerves. Yeah. Right. Anyway. I'd be a miserable existence. Well, I got to say, I got to say Dawson's not the only one making a triumphant return. We missed you Chris as well for the movie club that we did. And we missed you Dawson. It was a hell of a time. And for the meetup, which I got to say, I think there are a few people. Meetup who can attest that that was one of our spicy meetups. Oh my gosh. It really was. Really. That's the spicy meetup. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I believe my exact thing was, uh, if anything that I said in that meetup shows up anywhere on the internet, the meetups are going to change wildly. Wow. Yeah. It looks good time. This is my end until listeners. This is my first time hearing about how spicy this meetup was. So even I myself. This is the only way you could hear about it because everyone's cool there. And we don't record those. So we, uh, we talk a little shit. I've been a little too spicy even for me. I found it was pretty. But that way. Yeah. It's just a Gary was fired up. And I might have, you know. Yeah. We'll spill some tea. I got to get some, I ever get some off air. Yeah. The only thing I got there was, oh, I don't know. I hope we all get some off air fulfillment after this is done. Can't mean it. Yeah. The only thing I know is I know how the movie night went because Dawson listened to it and then just told me for beta everything that happened. So I was there. Yeah. But you guys did the sum of all fears. You know, I'm just going to be the quick comment here because movie junk of SLC commented about Bridget Moynihan saying that is right. She was quite a fox back in the day. Who were you talking about? We were talking about ppm. Okay. Let's ppm. All right. That'd be how he be. It's like a dream. It's like a dream. When I was home with my mom, we were looking for a movie to watch and I'm like, let's watch the sum of all fears. I had never seen it all the way through. And we watched it and I got two words. Boring. Wow. Wow. Did not enjoy way too fucking long. I've been an interesting perspective to have in total counterpoint. Oh, I'm talking about the greatest. Well, we have seen some stinkers and it is a it is joyful to me. It's it's it's prideful that our movie clubs are more entertaining than the actual movie we're talking about sometimes. I will say that that has definitely improved the format of these movie clubs because we used to do a live during the movie and then the person during these stinkers would have to just watch us all just suffering in real time for like 90 minutes. But now like you said Chris, you don't even necessarily even have to have seen the movie. We just fucking chat and make each other laugh for an hour like any other episode. Yeah. And I'm based off of a movie junkies, Clon, and talking about how delicious bullet is. I don't know, like I was talking about my food when I'm not there. To do ice, it brings bullet to school. And elementary school for those who don't know if the fertilized duck egg. That I mean it has all the stuff in it. You watch it down a lot more. Sometimes the beak right correct. I mean, I'm not you know, looking saw you're just I'm not saying you look. Well, it's really the selling point that I want for my food. Look at it just I'm not. Yeah, is it a pop it in your mouth and get it over. Look kind of thing. Take over all tastes. One bite. The second grade when I did this. So like I would bring it to I would bring it to class and and I didn't know what I was eating. I was just just open crack it open drink the juice put some salt. Oh, the juice. Oh, the juice is the best. You got a lot of salt. You got a lot of salt. Are you putting it on? Yeah, my mouth is. Now the juice is the best part. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So I've got to wonder if the juice is worth the crack. And it is in that case. But yeah, thanks for clomenting movie junky. I'll get to more clomets later in the show. Yeah, I can all agree with you Chris because I've smoked crack. That's nice. I was waiting for that. And I was hoping you're going to figure out a way to pick up on that. I don't know why that's not what you're not a spokesperson for more things to us. I mean Chuck Nibbles. Yeah, but we got to get you more that can be your lunch. I got to branch out a little bit. I got crack. I should try cigarettes. That can be your let's get ready to rumble. You have just trademark it and then just have big events and for big companies just right in. Yeah, move over briefbuffer. Yeah, this is put you movies and all the yeah, it can be the next best thing. So just everything. All right, look, we got we do have a lot to get into. I do have some parenting advice that I'm requesting from Kaelan and Gary. And I also want Dawson and Matt's advice as well. Just from an outsider's perspective of how I should have handled things. But I've been taking my kid to the park. It's a good way for him to get his energy out. I'm pro park. I love parks. Love meets to the park today. See. So far, this sounds like the relationship I have in my dogs. Yeah, too. Enjoy going to the park. I like going to the park. I'm getting some energy out. Yeah, and you meet a lot of other parents. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you're constantly telling them don't do that. Don't. And also don't park here. There's another thing. Dawson, Dawson just likes to go on. I don't, I'm not a big part of parks unless I like parks if they're empty. I guess I'm not a fan of people. Yeah. I would think as a cracksmoker, you would spend quite a lot of time in parks. But maybe that's what I need to be empty. It's all different these days. You don't get crack on the corner anymore. You text the dealer and then you meet inside. Keeps everybody safe. Oh, Dawson. You got to come down. You got to come down by my office. You can absolutely get it on the corner. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Every once. Yeah. There's no law there. So I do. And I love parks too. I mean, a lot of major life events that have had happened. Have happened in parks. And. So. Like what my earliest memories of happening. Like what? Did I tell you the first thing? First case meet up. First broken arm. No, I broke alarm in the driveway. I'm playing hockey. First hand job. Kick a street hockey puck. All right. Let's let's keep moving here. Let's keep moving anyway. Wait, you broke your arm trying to kick a hockey puck. Yeah. Wow. Dude. I used to play hockey. Were you wearing roller blades? Yes. Okay. Yes. You're playing hockey on, you know, without the roller blade. That's why I'm asking K. Yeah. You can reduce and you broke your arm trying to kick something. I would have some follow up. No, I was a big on the blades. Big blader. Like Matt. You and Matt together. You want to know those segue scooter things. Dude. You want to roll their blades. Dude. We'll see. We'll see who fails first. I'm. I am not exaggerating that my after school. Rich, was going home, putting in the VHS of D two, Mighty next part to you and and watching it, Really to the just to the part where they ran the crew, They're round of the old crew. Yeah, the whole big, big blade and scene. And then I would go out and start rollerblading and then you know, go in the driveway and practice a few knuckle packs, until like, tell you got it right, and then then one day, that was frustrated. It was one of those packs. Gary wouldn't know. Gary would know this. It's like a street puck with like the three little balls. A ball's in the middle. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I know these two. Orange with black balls. They they never worked as well as they were supposed to, but everyone wanted them because they looked cool. They looked cool. It is like, yeah, basically just had little little balls in there. So it would be a little supposedly slime. You would always end up getting a pebble in one of the balls. So that ball wouldn't spin so that the puck would never go in the direction it was supposed to because only two of the balls were spinning and the third one was like basically like stopping the puck. Yeah. And then they get like flat spots. It wasn't smooth. It wasn't smooth. It not really made for the streets, but I mean, you know, that, that was the times back then. And yeah, I remember just taking the puck and really frustrated and trying to drop kick it in roller blades, trying to, you know, just launch that thing. I'll jack black and anchor man to Will Ferrell's dog. And yeah, and just went a little too hard. And I'll break up another movie with the replacements. The way he like that kicker. Forget his name. Just. Damis. Huh? I believe the character's name was Shamus. Yeah, yeah, it's the way Shamus. Nice. Bull. I mean, I thought I know that movie by harder anything. Alright, P. Jean Hackman, by the way. Yeah. The, you can hack, but I'm sorry, real fast. Jean Hackman looked like the same age for like 45 years. And then you see the last picture of him before he died. I would not $100,000 on the table. I would not have been able to tell you that was Jean Hackman. Well, he retired for still long. He didn't, you know, he, he just said, I know. I'm just saying I feel like he looked about 68 from the time he was about 41 until the time he retired about 85. And then all of a sudden he's 95 and he looks unrecognizable. Yeah. I just, I've never seen, I was a very stark difference. It, I, I agree. It was, it was kind of a learning how different he, he looked in that picture. But I look, we'll get in a Jean Hackman a little bit if you guys want to talk Jean. But um, oh yeah. But let me let me just circle back. So I ended up breaking my arm. My brother saw it all happened. You, when you break your arm and this, maybe this is why I have such a bad experience watching people break their bones. It's pretty traumatizing to the point where like you just know it broke. Like you just know. And I remember my brother saw and he just came up to me like he looked concerned. But really just came up to point and laugh at me. And when you have a broken arm and a guy just pointing laughing at you, um, it's humiliating. It's, it's, it's, it's, infuriating. It's traumatizing. This is your brother. Oh yeah. But you see it and think I broke my arm. You just saw me eat crap. This is okay. All right. Um, yeah. My, my fingers swell that my hand looked like, uh, when how he mandell blows into a latex glove for that one bit. Like that's what my hand looked like. And I was like, all right. So then end up having a pretty crazy, broken wrist to where it was like offset and that day he had to like push the bones back together. And it was the worst, easily the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. And, you know, I've had hard break in high school. So you can tell me how much that really hurt. And um, and so I just, yeah, I, that vivid memories of me breaking my arm playing, um, while bleeding. Anyway, love me some parts though. And, um, this could explain your overall dislike of hand trauma. It could. Yeah. I think you could. If we want to, if we want to, this is your origin story, you know, if you want to trace it back, it could, I've, I've had two traumatic hand experiences. Uh, if you can see in, I don't know if it'll focus, I mean, I could probably get it to focus a little bit here. Focus on me. Yeah. I mean, this is not going to be worth the payoff, is it? No, no, you can't see it anyway. That's how it came out pretty quickly. I have, I have about it's like a, almost a two inch in between my thumb and my index finger right here. And that is from when I was a kid, I love me some frozen bananas. And for some crazy reason, um, did you like frozen bananas for like having a frozen banana now or like if you want to regular banana later? Uh, I'm a frozen banana now. I wanted to cold the cold frozen banana. You know, if chocolate dipped even better, I wish I was fucking one one hundred this funny is Mitch Hadberg. I could have a career. Like I was great. He was, he was incredible. Um, anyway, so I, I wanted frozen banana. My mom's like, I froze some bananas for you. Now look, I love my mom. She's brilliant. She, she raised three kids as a single parent. Abel gives everything we ever wanted. Um, and I respect her dearly. She's, she's honestly just incredible. This is not Patriot. What are you kidding? I'm going to build it like she is just incredible. Truly amazing. I don't know how she did what she accomplished, what she was able to accomplish, um, raising three kids by herself. Like that ZZ tops song. Yeah. Yeah. Well, while, while having these successful career as an immigrant from the Philippines, who that's a, that would pay. Yeah, dude, you got she, that was her career, um, being an immigrant. Yeah, but she also became a nurse too. Anyway, uh, side hustle as a nurse. Um, smart, smart. You got to have that side hustle. Yeah. But I mean, shit, dude. Why do you mean, what are the, what are the hours? Um, so she's like I froze some bananas for you. They're in the freezer. Go get them. And I go, and the bananas are in the freezer with with the peel on. And I've never frozen it before. But her bananas. She just threw them in the freezer. She's like, oh, get it. And, uh, you know, look, I'll be honest, we're Filipino. Frozen bananas are not our thing. We don't we don't do that. That's not our thing. We eat duck eggs. That's what I brought to school. I never brought a frozen banana to school. So I'm thinking, all right, well, better get this peel off the banana. So, um, I knew where the nice were. I just got to cut this peel right off. Oh, God. I mean, going. I am in second grade. A lot of stuff happened. I mean, second grade. Um, the broken arm thing was like in fifth grade. But, and I go to the counter. And I'm holding the banana at the counter. And I'm trying to cut it with like a butter knife. Because that's the only, those are millionaires that really available to me. Like the the standard with your standard flatware, not like a steak knife, but that other knife that they gave you that you're like, all right, this is kind of a JV knife. It's kind of weak, but it's too. It's a sharp. Yes, it is a butter knife. But may I applaud your use of the word flatware. Thank you. I'm impressed by that. Hey, I'm cultured. I'm and some trying to say I first heard that word when I was like 47. Yeah. Yeah. And I was always impressed by it. Simply because of the person who used the word flatware. So, eloquently in a conversation and this person was cultured and this person was success. You know, the, you know, the great research that you said flatware, what pettape, I was jacks at. I mean, you can we close the flatware. Could have been British. Could have been British. Could have been cockney. Kailin, do they say flatman? That's an ugly language. Could have been slain. Good. Minner and Australian saying for that way. It wasn't Australia. We all know. It was definitely the British and as a British person, I can honestly say this is the first time hearing of this word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kailin. Good. Like I know British cultured, they started. Yeah. Good run there. Definitely. Yeah. I didn't make it to 47, but welcome to your life after flatware dude. Everything changes now. Well, they call apartments flats and then you do. And then what do you call the silverware in those set of parvets? Flatware. Duh. Oh, nice. Yeah. I don't think they have anything to do with each other. Yeah. Another really on there. Perfectly correlated. So, I have the banana and I'm holding it. And I'm trying to sort off with this super javy week, better. And if it's not working, and I think, okay, I'm just going to start stabbing it. So I get the knife. And I start stabbing this banana. Now, this banana has been out of the freezer for a little bit. So some condensation has formed at the top. And you got to stop with the visual display. The focus is terrible. And I can't fucking hear you because they're blocking the microphone. Yeah. I got this. I got this. I'm a nunsyating. And I'm some stabbing this banana. Chris pulled the armrest out of his car. I do have a making it look like a banana. I'm just stabbing it for all of you. Or just listening to the audio version. I have props. Yes. I am using props. And I'm stabbing this banana. Looks like you're jerking off a pen. And then I'm going to angle to where the knife slips on a banana. And just straight in here and goes into my hand and stabs my hand. I'm gonna throw up. Oh, you want to talk this? This is where my hand trauma came from. All right, stabs my hand goes about a quarter of the knife in. And I'm all by myself in the kitchen. I don't know what's going on. So I'm like, oh boy. And you're no one's going on. On this, that happened a lot when you're all alone in the kitchen. Like what the fuck is that thing? The keeps food cold. I don't know what's going on. Yeah. It's so shocking. That I don't even feel it. Yeah, right. You're just like in shock. Oh, God. So I take the knife out. I just rip the knife out. And I am looking now inside my hand. I remember it. I remember vividly. I'm looking inside my hand because I can see this and the blood hasn't started yet. So I'm just looking like, oh my God. And I'm just looking in my hand and all the sudden this blood blood just starts gushing out everywhere. And I start screaming and crying. And yeah, and that's why I have this big scarf. So maybe that's a tail in number 20 minutes ago when Chris said you wanted parent to get advice. I do. Anyway, that's probably where my hand trauma stems from. Now back to the park. I've been taking my kids in the park. And he's a very sweet boy. Look, I am biased, but I can tell you he's a very sweet boy, very nice, nice kid. And he's very friendly to all the kids. He says hello. He says hi. I mean, that's pretty much all he can really, you know, that's conversationaly. That's all he, that's as far as he gets. But but he enjoys talking to the other kids. And there's this girl there. I've never seen her before. She's probably year or two older than him. I would say old maybe even three years. She's she's a young but she's all over the place. She's running. She sees him. My kid goes hello. Just gives him a weird glare and just keeps moving on. All right, fine. You don't know if he has to respond to him. He doesn't care. I don't care. Whatever. And then my kid decides to play with one of those like little wheels that you spin in the playground up on one of the levels of the park and she goes up there and she pushes him away to spin the wheel. And basically she's bullying him every single part of the park where he wants to go play with. She gets in front of him to do to use it and doesn't let him touch it. And then she goes up to her dad and goes, hey, I don't like that kid. I don't like that boy. I start to pointing at my kid and the dad doesn't even look up from his phone because I like it. And now she is following and harassing my kid. And it's not she's not my kid. I don't know what to say to her. I'm like, hey, man, let's just go over here. We'll just feel like do our own thing here. And he's like, but we have to share my kids like put share. You taught me to share. And now I'm like, oh my god, you're questioning the values that I have instilled in you already because of this of this girl who I mean all of you on a center of my breath. I called her a lot worse than girl. And I'm just looking at the dad just glued to his phone the whole time to sit in there. She's going up to him. Tell him how much he hates my kid and then in just proceeds. So I don't want him touching anything in this park. No, and he goes up like, no, you can't have that. No, you can't use that. No, this is mine. No. And just telling my kid no to where everywhere I take him to the park. She's following him to harass him. Now I don't know what to do. Be, I don't know this dad. He's obviously checked out. Yeah. This kid. What what's the dad like physically? If this. Yeah. That's true. But is there a large group of dads taking their kids with the park? Oh, yeah, there is actually. I think it's not existent. I think this is a way for you just get your kids energy out and just like let them go in dads don't. I mean, I mean, yeah, they're like, they're all careful here. Yeah, let's get let's you try to get them to nap time. That's all you're trying to do as a father really is in those first few years is get your child to fall asleep. Right. It's not even just nap time. It's like, I mean, my kids right a point now where they won't even take a nap, but they need that energy needs to be out by the time. It's nighttime. So it's nap time. It's not time for you. You gotta go run them. I do see them a lot of park. You have to run your kids. I see a lot of dads there. I take the dog for a walk, but you guys, you guys, you guys, here is after run your children. They usually run themselves, which is yeah, yeah, hopefully they do. That's good. They can be self-sufficient. I guess a park is a pretty good space for that. Good space. Yeah. And a lot of dads you take there and I and I bad it's just, you know, it's just like an easy thing to just take your kids and you don't have to think it too hard about what in activity you have to do. They'll have a good time. I took my kids today. It was mostly dads that were there. Yeah. Okay. I'm pretty much all that. Maybe maybe maybe the time of day thing, but yeah. Are you guys smoking crack while you're watching your kids in the park? We have shifts. We have shifts. Oh, our park. We have shifts. So like two guys, I believe the kid and the car thing goes score. Yeah. Now Chris, I actually take a little bit of the opposite stand here. I think you should not be resisting this. I think he'd let it happen. This this guy he's raising a strong independent women. All right, respect to women. You're son is going to have a long life ahead of him and dealing with women like this. So better get used to it now. Yep. Right. Right. I'm just saying he just learned what to do. That's a fun tip for people. I'm giving him giving Matt fondlier and a ward that has never been given out before, but the greatest thing ever said on a podcast, a ward. I I left out something. I'm going to need a. That's when I said have that scripted out, but yeah, we'll get it on a plaque. That was that was the greatest thing ever said in a podcast. Oh, so Caitlin and Gary, do you have any objection to Dawson giving Matt the award during this parenting second? You didn't answer Gary's question. Oh, well, what's Gary's question? Thank you. Can you repeat Gary? What's the dad like physically? He looks like Caitlin. Cut, maybe older than Caitlin, but like the physical physical physicality of Caitlin. 190. He was older than me. Let me tell you. If you were to describe that Chris, would you say that's really strong, really manly like what adjectives would you use to describe that? Yeah. You know, they're just saying it looks like let us know. What 90. No, it is tall. It's attractive. He's worth to describe it. Tall dreamy attractive. Looks like you're going to look like Michael Bean. Yeah, so so anyway, I guess what Matt's magic Caitlin. You have a, you with the parker, we're. Yeah, I guess this is my way of confronting you, killing your daughter was being such a bitch. Anyway, so it's eight honestly, it upset me. So it ruined my day. Seeing this in your right, Matt, he's going to go through this a lot. There's going to be a lot of this kind of stuff. Not even with just women, with other human beings. And I get that. But if you want an actual answer to this question, I have it. Excuse me. Take your award and please, please proceed. Thank your award. It's down. I will, I will concede. Now your answer is, is much better of an answer in terms of entertainment. But I have kind of seen this behavior with my kids. And I'm not the one to do it. But I've seen how Amy reacts in this situation. And as someone who teaches kids and special needs kids, as much as you want to go to the parent first, you want to like go up to the kid and your kid when they're together and tell them in like a friendly manner. Hey, we don't do that. We share this and you like do it in the kid voice. And that's how you do it without making the parent angry. But also telling the kid like, hey, fucking knock it off. Okay, Chris. So, Kevin, right. But I think the theory is a tactic that is available to you exclusively in terms of the people on this podcast, Chris, that you, you know, really need to keep in your back pocket. If you're as heated up about this, you know, as it sounds like you got, I think you need to play the race card and you accuse a little bit. What races the little girl doesn't matter. I mean, Chris, I'll tell you. Kailin's advice. Kailin's advice is great advice if you want the guy to think you're a fucking pussy. I disagree. Oh, very disagree. I think advice is right. I think that I agree. My wife is better at it than I am. But that is the most effective way to do it. If the other parent is not going to engage at all, then the only way for you to really handle it and is being a don't be a parent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it getting there and, you know, well, if you're not going to handle this shit, I am pretty much a parent mode get in there. Now you have to parent two child, two children, because I'll guarantee you this fucking Michael being in looking motherfucker at the kid park. He's an actor and right now he's failing as acting as a father. I didn't say the name. Yes, so these kids are just just playing about and I and the dad's over on his phone playing with his Yamacag guitar. And yeah, you're, look, Jenny was there too. And so I had somebody to talk to and really call this girl names under my breath. And she agreed 1000% I mean, this is, it was pretty appalling how this girl was acting. So it was nice to have that validation at least. But all right, I'll try the sing songy double just the louder kind of as if I'm a teacher. You don't even before you even get to that point because I've been at the park with my kids when I mean, it doesn't, I don't think it's been getting bullied like as bad as that sounds, but if I'm not really not really vibing the way the other kids are fun. And they're like, I'll go over there and like stand there. Like I'll just make my presence known. They're like, this is my kid. I'm not going to watch him. And they can kind of feel it. They can kind of sense, all right. I'm going to maybe back off a little bit. The fact that you grow when they get to glass, you're really weird. Yeah, yeah, you start peeing on the swings. Smart. Yeah, let's do awesome stuff. I mean, look out of my guitar toy show your. The horrible factory system is not as advanced as a canines or a few lines. So when we pee on swings and slides, other kids don't usually get the point until they've actually sat in the pee. No, did. Yeah, and can't confirm as well. Our kids remind me that'll be a shit I did or but what did I do? What did I do? Did I pee or did I sit in it? We know you did both. That was a good idea. Is it good? We all know he did a meal. It's a good. The Patreon baby. Get the Patreon. All right. Well, thanks for your advice. I think I'm going to just because Killon has had some recent interactions that are similar to this. I will try to heat his advice most and make my presence known. Exactly. That's out. Right. All right. Well, Killon said what he said. I was done. I just said that. All right. Well, speaking speaking of our kids to you, I know Gary, you took Gary Jr. For the experience of a lifetime. Well, it's going to be multiple of these experience because this is you basically be good. Yeah, I opened Pandora's box and I took my son for the first time to Benny Hauna. So before the mic, he did up Gary was teasing us. Like guys, I did something with my son. He's never done it before. I want to talk about it. And yeah, and everybody already knew it was Benny Hauna. Taught some guests it right away. I really wanted, I wish we had that on record because it was pretty incredible stuff. But this is after the Oscars. It was actually during the Oscars. We, you know, I probably the best time to get a seed Benny Hauna, right? I thought of you honest with you, Dawson. It was pretty light. It's not. It was pretty lit. It was okay. It was the first time that I've ever, that I can remember going to Benny Hauna and there were empty seats at the table. Right. There was my three people and then there was another three three-person family and then there were two empty seats in between us. And I don't think I've ever done that before. Like I have many stories of extended wait times at Benny Hauna, even with reservations when they're waiting for the right combination to make sure they can fill that whole table. Yeah. So this was, this was a first for me. But yeah, we took him, he loved it. He was not a fan of the 20 or 30 minute wait where you get the soup and you get the salad and there is no show and he called me a liar because he said that there's no shell and they don't cook in front of you and they just brought you that soup and salad and that's definitely not how you sold this. He must have felt so betrayed like he was probably here to eat salad. He was best. He literally called me a liar. You know what to do in that in that situation is you bully him like that little girl would bully Chris's kid. Yeah, I call them a racist. Yeah, I call them a racist. Yeah, they're making you a stupid. I should not. Smart. But you know, we did try to sort of prepare him for this because it's you know, it's an unconventional experience. It's not until you've been, you know, for us, it's old hat. We've all done this million times. You know what the experience is like. But I tried to sort of prepare him for it and it was a combination of like, you know, it's a little different and a little bit of, you know, trying to hype him up and sell him and, you know, what's the big selling point that you're going to sell a five year old on anyone? Oh, it grew food or the onion volcano, right? Exactly. Right. I mean, the onion volcano and eventually out came our chef, he introduced himself. He starts doing the thing. He's cooking. He's throwing the rice on there. He's got to yada and my wife announces that she's going to the bathroom and he announces he wants to go with her and he missed the volcano. Oh, no. And I don't think he, I, I video taped it, which was a little uncomfortable. I think for the other group at my table because it's sort of impossible to not have them in the shot. I tried my best, but I had to get this video because if he came back and he was me being a liar once again about the volcano, I needed to have video evidence. I was not going to call him a racist. So you took a video of the table next to you. Interesting. No, you're not the table. I turned your my table man and it was for a five year old. It's like one filming at a restaurant should be doing it for now. I got to say, I know, I'm not to question your parent habits or you're, you know, what you tried to do here about parenting. But I think you could lean into what I would have done in the situation, which is as soon as your wife and kid get up, you got to lean into the chef and go, can you like wait a minute until you do the onion volcano? Show. Just wait to lay it back, please. Just like that. Wait, Matt. Sorry, I was saying that you're going to ask the people at the restaurant to wait a little bit before serving your food. That's a good thing. We're literally inconvenience the chef and the other diners just out of selfishness for your five world. I Matt, I guess I have no questions, no follow-ups. Under no circumstances would that have ever crossed my mind. I don't know. I said, why not? What's the difference? I can't back you up on this one. Or have no one again? All right, they're back now. Do you do the thing? Would you do that, Matt? If you went to Beni Hanna and you're like, I don't want any of those onions hitting the grill to end with my me so soup. That dude. And if you can't do that, if you can't do that, I won't see Benny. Yeah, I got some things to say to Benny. Yeah, I'm not going to be a nightmare for you, Matt. They make that food and just serve it when they choose and you're normally just filled with everything on the play by the end of it. Like you can't. It's fast enough to keep up with how quickly they serve the food at Beni Hanna. You know how Chris spent 20 minutes the beginning of his podcast explaining his origin story of how his trauma began. You've just summed it up right there, my friend. So many days at Beni Hanna. Just food coming, coming, coming, coming. So much is paced out to House of Horrors for Matt. Yeah, next time is Gary, on your cell, you got to undersell everything dude. You got to aim low all the time, get your cousin. And then and then everything is like holy shit dude, when dads around fucking magic happens. Well, I just feel like this is really to go get some dinner and then the guy makes a fucking volcano and you're like, the first time we took him, you don't mention the volcano. You don't mention the heart. You don't even mention the fun egg trick. You just go, they make the food in front of you. And that's it. And you let him be surprised by the rest. And if this shows not good. Yeah, harm doesn't. I did the one, the only thing that I told especially and almost exclusively undersell Beni Hanna. Well, it didn't really matter because at the end of it, he told me that the experience was 100 out of 10. So, you're by best with Beni Hanna and I'm very happy for you all over the year. What's that? I said, did you ask for your apology then? Yeah, I'm glad he's young. I know what are you to do. But I have a two story Beni Hanna opening very close to my house in the very near future. So, I'm very excited that he liked it because I know we will be going back. And I will tell you that the experience as Beni Hanna, which sounds like it was a fun delightful evening for you and your family. With one child is much different when you have two children. Oh, I can imagine. The amount of chaos that ensues between four people, two parents, two kids, the soups, the salad, all the food that it's nonstop shuffling of plates. It's nonstop scooping for it's nonstop things getting dropped on the floor. It is chaos. It is not. It sounds to me. What do you get to that level? It sounds to me like a short form documentary chaos at Beni Hanna. I want to see that. I will watch that and I will narrate that for free. Make it. It was saying Netflix. Let's do it, dude. Yeah, I need to get a fucking camera crew. I have a Beni Hanna. That's happening. I encourage Matt to film more Russia. Matt, you're in, dude. We're doing this. Let's do it. All right. Well, anyway, I'm glad that Gary Jr. had such a good time. I mean, you're going to get that second story. Beni, you're going to go in top floor. Right. First time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I request the that before. What does it matter? What do you mean with that? No window. What is it? What is it? What have you ever had Beni Hanna? Upstick, you're taking care of Gary. Thank you. Is that what? And I will very soon. You got to go. It's like a bunk bed. If you get a bunk bed or you're going to request bottom bunk every time. No, the reason you want a bunk, but it's so you can feel it. See what it's like to get that top bunk. And tell you get all the time. Wild experience. And tell you get old enough. Yeah. Then at one point, you get old enough and be like, you know, I do not, I'm not climbing to bed. I'm falling into bed and you make somebody else take it. Okay. And there's a reason that every downtown has a restaurant that's on the rooftop floor of a skyscraper. I mean, you got to eat it out. That doesn't. You got to eat it out. Dude. Yeah. I don't know. You're not wild. You can get out to bed. It's the way to go. It's called out to food. Out to food. That's it. That's it. I hear by the award you. If anyone, ever set on a podcast award. If anyone ever asks what this podcast is about, just say it's a bunch of dudes like shortening things into words. Yeah. Just awarding things to each other. We would be breathing. Yeah. I dig in your sneeze. Yeah. Oh, all right. Let's see a couple of comments before we get out of here. You guys down. What's happening? We're doing Colombians. Well, okay. There we go. Let's see some comments real quick. All right. These are all cloments delivered to us by you. The listeners. Yes. There are a couple ways to give us cloments where we can read and react to your musings as well. First off, it's joining our Patreon. It's five bucks a month minimum. You get an extra episode a week along with ad free episodes and opportunities for meetups and movie clubs and things like that. We're which we talked about earlier. So please do not extra episode is recorded pretty much consecutively like a 10 minute P break. And I'm only on. I'm only on three beers. Like I said, he's getting there. I'm only on three. How I can take a second. I'm an early, I'm an early slur. Awesome. What ever gets three claws in right now? So. But we're this is good. This next show is going to be fucking great too. It just tastes fairly for this show. Yeah. Absolutely. At this rate, we'll be recording Patreon in 15 minutes. You can hear what Dawson sounds like on seven beers. By the end, because I only have seven. Oh, okay. So yeah, let's let's raise, ration them. Now, another way to leave cloments is by joining our Facebook group. And that is free. And it's a wonderful community. We started this few years back and it's always growing, which we love. All you have to do is go to Facebook dot com slash groups slash bobo boy army worldwide LLC. They need to be questioned to my legend. Very easy. And my favorite place on the net. So let's do a quick, a comment from the Facebook group. This is Jacob Morales. He used to use us. I have a weird question and he says my friend put hot sauce on his mashed potatoes. What's say you guys? And the, the, the, the, I don't hate it. I'm not, I'm okay with this. Yeah, the choices are I don't hate it. Hot sauce can go on everything and anything. Hot sauce is only good for meat dishes or hot sauce is an apology for poorly made dishes. Okay. The second to our insanity. Whoa. It's a wide gap. See, and that's that's the reason why I voted for hot sauce can go on anything. But if one of the choices was, are you, are you a psycho path? I would have chosen are you a psychopath? You never in my life will I put unless mashed, like if you ever had a mashed potato taco, you're there good and Mexico, you get a carrot taco and you got to, you know, stay at somebody's nana's house. But I was vegan potato tacos. Carrot tacos and potato tacos are the fucking thing. But a lot of a price. Um, that sounds like there's a one. That's the only way you're allowed to put hot sauce on mashed potatoes. It's gravy, butter, or, and either, or nothing else I've spoken. This poll is missing at least one. I mean, as the rule of the lands. How to fuzz. Yeah. The reason of castle crust. This poll is one and probably two options between the first one and the last two because the last two are just utter insanity. Hot sauce is only for meat. What about it? Yeah. Hot sauce is for anything you want to put it on to burn. That was the only logical answer. So yeah, everyone who answered otherwise is probably a psychopath as well. Well, 81% said hot sauce can go on everything or anything and then 17% say hot sauce is an apology and then 2% said hot sauce is only for good for meat dishes. So I want to put this thing you guys put hot sauce on. I have an answer and um, I did it. I run a great to meet this. Mine is not mine. Oh, mine sounds like a meat dish. It's animal style fries and I put the racha on that to kill us this may. I haven't even thought of this doing this before. I will be blown by mine right now. Fucking. Right. That sounds pretty good, Kaelan. Or Chris. Srocha on animal style fries. Oh, yeah. It's chef's kiss. You're how do we feel about the animal style fries? I feel as though I love the animal style fries, but I feel like the amount of spread and grilled onions they give you makes it three bites of animal style grilled fries or animal style fries followed by just friend fries. All right. Yeah, that's why you get extra spread by the way. I'm on the rookie move dude. Kaelan, I 100% I you know, I'm not. And then you get extra spread packs on the side because there's no. Kaelan, come on, we live together. You know, I can't believe in this world where I have three bites of animal style fries and just move on. Kaelan, the way they honestly, I kind of like it because you get that top layer of animal style and then you get that bottom layer of just regular fries where you guys are still doing the spread. You come through those things by the time you get them home there to soggy. Yeah. That's where you get them. Yeah. And I also as as a fry connoisseur claiming it now, T.M. I like to be in control when not eating my fries. I don't want you to decide how much sauce or whatever I'm going to have on my fries. Usually I just eat the fries was salt and I just always ask for more salt, which is why I'm now in a heart medication. But, all right, well, here's the thing. And before it, before I make this point, let's explain to the the culvers and what a burger enthusiast out there what animal style fries are. They're in a no fries with no, I know. I know. I know. Okay. Yeah. With melted cheese, spread and grilled onions. There's some other with with yeah, and it's awesome. Now, I'll take a double double animal style. But the fries, I respect in and out fries because there is a dude making 1750. And he's in the first part of the building you see as you pull up through the drive through. And you know what that dude is? He's grabbing potatoes and he's putting him in a potato cutter and he's pulling down this large clamp and shooting the potatoes through French fry blades into a bin that then is going to be cooked and served to you. Yeah. I think it's a beautiful thing. And get his fries to serve. Yeah. The hero. Um, so. And I like to be in control of my fries. Well, here's the thing. That's why they offer you the animal style option, which you can do for your burgers. You can do for your fries, which they add a little extra juge and flavor and intensity to your meal. And does when you order animal style, you're not ordering the food animal style. It's because you're freaking animal and you want them to do all that stuff to your food. Okay. You're the one that's the animal. So yeah, if you're ordering animal style fries, the fries will really thought of it. Yeah. So that's why that's why you're just an animal like I am. Okay. Thank you for answering my question. I have some follow-ups here. Right. Because of the aforementioned sort of lack of animal contents on the fries, are you adding more spread to this. And if so are you doing that before you apply your surraucher. I mean, you know how to do this correctly. Okay. This is. This is going to be. Look. I'm not proud of a lot of things I know. I'm not proud of a lot of things I've brought. I'm so glad I asked this question. I need to know how to do this right. It's weird because Kaelan used to give me so much crap for putting Saracha on my animal cell fries. So I'm excited that he's now turned a corner. Since forgotten his true opinion about it. I have a head to not remember. All right. But more to the point. Putting hot sauce on mashed potatoes is absolutely insane. Unless it's in a taco. Yeah. Strange. But I'm going to try it the next time I'm eating mushrooms. I'm fine. Oh yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. I mean, I wouldn't personally do it. But if you want to do it, I'm talking with me. Not on my table dude. Kaelan, what you do. So what I do is I ask for an extra packet of spread, which is about one tenth of what Kaelan asked for. Is that what you call it? Spread. Yeah. Did you say it in a really sexy voice? Can I get a. That's my regular voice. I can have a packet of spread and yeah, but people somehow think my voice is really sexy when I ask and I really weird. So I get the spread. And now what I do, Kaelan, is I take the fries that are in the box. Because they, they give it to you in a different kind of box. It's usually a closed box. So you open the box up. And now you have two little boats of of of of wake up at the fries. And you have the little fry tray in the box. I take the fry tray and I turn it upside down to where now I'm just seeing dry fries at the top in the cheese bread. And the, I need to add the bottom. And I put the spread on that part. And then I take the suracha and I put that on top of that and then I stir it up. And now each fries even we coated with sriracha, a little extra spread grilled on knees and cheese. And each bite is better than last. And I look forward to my mouth that I'm thinking about it. So yeah, I'm a freaking animal. Is they like a problem with the melted cheese and the onions. Then just sticking to the bottom of the boat that you flipped it onto. No, we've very, very amateur. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Chris, please close the box and shake it up. A pretty smart point. Yeah. I've been working live events for a long time. There's catering like basic catering. They'll be that thing at chicken cutlets or something. Or, you know, Philly, G's, Dakes or hot dogs. The only thing that was ever consistent in live event catering is the salad. Salad bar. They got all the stuff in the salad bar. And you find out early on that you make a bowl of salad. And you put all your stuff on it. And then you get a second bowl. And you top it. And then you marimba. Shake the salad bowls. And then, but one underneath and boom, you got a toss. Salad bro, just like that. I'll tell you how to toss a salad. Yeah. And I'll tell you in detail. So it all started with McDonald's. You just have like these salad shakers. We're salad cheeses. You like those salad and they basically gave it to you in a cup. And you just put the the dressing it and then you would shake it like a martini. But the thing about shaking a salad and like a salad, a closed salad case. You got to do the horizontal movement. It's all hor, if you go vertical when you shake, you're not going to release it for some reason. It's the horizontal shake that really gets you the extra coding of dressing on each. Yeah. You got to go side to side. Then you got to go front and yeah, that's right. But as long as it's on the horizontal axis, I'm more of a front. You want to go vertical. Yeah. You don't want to go vertical because then all your dressing is going to stick to the lid and the bottom of the container. So you're working on two dimensions. You may as well explore all the territory. I've got vertical and I'm going to say if you really want to toss a salad right. You got to go front to back inside decide. But I wouldn't I wouldn't go vertical. You guys if you go or or anti pepper and chini in salads. See what I'm so pro pepper and chini and everything. Everything. All right. We have a put that in access. Redater. I love pepper and chinis. Yeah. It's like what you do with hot sauce. I was hoping we could add that to our water cooler crest that were pro pepper and chini. Yeah. Follow me. Yeah. We're pro and chini. Yeah. That's pretty good Matt. All right. No. It's a funny. Yeah. Now we're going. Let's let's end comments there. Four. Four. Four. Four. Years really a sweet spot for Matt's cognitive. Yeah. Three. All right. Well, I mean, I can't wait to see the four. I can't wait to see what four brings us. During Patreon. So those are a climate. That was our climate. We definitely more. We'll get to the next week and the thanks. I rate for writing and like and and join our Facebook group. I mean, Casey Peters needs help with his break pads. And for caution, or has something about mystery movie Mondays that that sounds fun and you know, cat. He'll be loud. He's going to Italy and she has a funny meme about about a dog with a chef's had. I mean, you want to see all this doing the Facebook group. And then our patrons, see, we got a lot of great stuff on there as well. Like Don Powell will just wrote a comment that's it that starts off with Gary's right. And then he goes on and talking about all this other stuff. We don't read that. We don't need it. We can relate or so anyway, why don't we go around the horn. Get our plugs in and then we'll go ahead and start on Dawson's fourth beer. So I'll start in Austin, Texas, Matt fondalier. What do you suggest we check out or the Dawdin's checks out? Well, you should definitely check out our Patreon patreon dot com slash water cooler. He get the second half of tonight's episode. And the ad free I got to say is a really, really good option to select. And also just say the movie Wainsworld. I just rewatch that again. God damn, that is just fucking stone cold classic. So good. That's the everything I want to play. What, how did Wainsworld get back into your life? So I am oftentimes trying to find like a stupid comedy to watch on a Friday night. And they just don't make those kind of movies anymore. It's very hard to find a great modern comedy. So we've been dipping back to the the older classics. We also recently watched the naked gun, which I had not seen in a very long time. Again, just wall to wall. I joke for moving that movie. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Love it. I love that you're doing that too. I look to those kind of movies for comfort myself. So yeah, I recommend everybody do that. All right, Kalean. What do you suggest people check out? Go check out just foolin' about podcast. That's me and my dad's podcast. There's a great new episode out today with the director Adam Wingard who did the Godzilla Verse King Kong movies.

It's just not going to be today. Oh, good. No. We got good pee. I've been to this today. Think about it. I guess yeah. But anyway, yeah. We got the way you just did. You just responded all of that. Not once. So it's kind of the easiest way to do that. No. But it's putting it on them. They got to listen to the podcast. Now I got to search out. How about this, Dustin? Instead of thanking everybody personally, just send them a link to the. Show. You know, one of the things that's more like that. Just put it. Just put it. Just put it. Just put it. Just put it. Just put it. Time. Good. That's pretty good. That's the awful. Wow. I might actually listen to the show for the first time ever. I mean. You're going to skip to the end. They're a whiter like you. Right. I mean. You got to listen through and hear altitude. I mean. Come on. Fucking gold. That time could have them earn it. Also. Also about. I'm going to say three years ago. You guys ever eat the Vinny Tortoritch, Alter Fat. I tried it. Back in the day. You're talking about it. Almond Ballman butter or whatever. Yeah. Well. I got an old one somewhere. I couldn't find an old one. But I have a recurring delivery of these. And to be honest, what I've eaten today and this is probably why the alcohol has affected me so fast. I've eaten four of of five of Vinny Tortoritch is Alter Fat Energy. So you get some fucking protein. A broccoli shake. And because I just don't eat unless I feel inspired to cook. You know what I mean? So Vinny Tortoritch is stuff gets me through the day. I just work. I told Vinny in an email about three years ago. Hey, bro. The packaging of these things hits the corners of your mouth. And like you can't. You're in danger of cutting your lips when you eat these. The next time you man your facture these things. Please consider making a smaller opening so that you can get your mouth around it. I got my reoccurring. I got my reoccurring. I got my reoccurring. I got my recurring delivery from Vinny Tortoritch today. And this is the new packaging. Oh, she. That's the old. He did it. Mark two, baby. He did it. Nice. These now I'm no longer in danger of cutting my mouth wide open when I eat one of these things. And if you do it wrong, you could. I mean, you got to be really special to make it happen. But it is possible. Yeah. To be clear, you're not supposed to eat the wrapper, right? No, dude. It's it's it's it's a mixture of like. Edible wrap. You know, you buy peanut butter and the oil sits on top. I would totally do it. You know, when you buy peanut butter and the oil sits at the top, the good kind of peanut butter that you got to really blend. Yo, yeah. So these things, these things do separate. So you just mix them up and essentially you're eating peanut butter. But it's from awesome nuts, not garbage nuts. It's all mint. It's all mint butter. It's good stuff. It's very it's very good. I have a few of them in my pantry as well. And now you want throw them out knowing that there's a smaller whole version. So my last plug is for C minus. Here's the number four. Thanks guys. I had to make up because I listened to the shows like eight times. I didn't get any plugs. You got to catch up. And if you mathematically times all the times I heard your guys' plugs. Kind of feel like I'm owed a few more this time. So thank you. Really? It's good to make it right. Then ask for me, please, be clear banana before freezing them. Alright, that'll do it for the steps out of water, cooler. Thank you so much for hanging out with us. We back to BETRON layer this week. We love you, good bye.
