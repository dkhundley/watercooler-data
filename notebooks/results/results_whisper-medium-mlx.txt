 Water cooler! Ba ba ba da! Water cooler! Ba ba ba da! Hey, welcome to Water Cooler! Thank you so, so much for tuning in and hanging out with us once again. You know how the show goes. I, Chris Locksamana, kick it with my Corolla Digital Buds of yesteryear, Philly style. With me today, all the way in Austin, TX. It's Mr. Matt Fondalier. Hey, brother! Hi, Matt. And then, all the way in Long Beach, California, like myself, it's Kaelin Bean. What's going on? Hi, Kaelin. Hey, Chris. And not much is going on, except, you know, I'm getting to pod with my good buds. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. And then all the way in Orange County, California, it's Gary Smith. Adi Pana. You know, I think Orange County is getting very close to claiming that saying the way Gary is evolving each time. So you better tell your Texas buddies to step it up, Matt. Go send the message out now. We'll wait. All right, he's gone. And then back, making his triumphant return all the way in, he's back in NoHo, California. That's right. Mr. Mike Dawson. Yeah, I noticed how you incorporated a little bit of a hand jive into your mouth licks there, Chris. Oh, yeah. And stepped it up a bit. You know, it was very... I did listen to the shows three times each. Of course. And the movie night. But I didn't do the video. Oh, that's unusual. So this time, I don't know if that's something new. It's fresh, exciting. It's so inviting to me. Yeah. Yeah, you know how... you know of... what is it? Synthesia? Synthesia? What is it called when you see... Anesthesia. Anesthesia. Symmetry. I just get super numb when I hear music. And I can't... yeah, my body just goes completely crazy because I have no feeling in my nerves. Matt's right. It's anesthesia. And that's what happens when I hear music and when I feel the music. It's just I get really numb. It's like someone just shot up a bunch of Novacaine into all of my nerves. Yeah. Right. Anyway... That would be a miserable existence. I got to say Dawson's not the only one making a triumphant return. We miss you, Chris, as well for the movie club that we did. And we miss you, Dawson. It was a hell of a time. And for the meetup, which I got to say, I think there are a few people at the meetup who can attest that that was one of our spicier meetups. Oh, my God. For sure. It really was. Really? That's a spicy meetup. Yep. He had to say multiple times, please don't put anything on Reddit. Please. Yeah. I believe my exact thing was if anything that I said in that meetup shows up anywhere on the Internet, the meetups are going to change wildly. Wow. Yeah, it was a good time. This is my... and to the listeners, this is my first time hearing about how spicy this meetup was. So even I myself... This is the only way you could hear about it because everyone's cool there and we don't record those. So we talk a little shit. It was a little too spicy even for me. Put it that way. Let's just say Gary was fired up and I might have, you know... Yeah. May as well spill some tea. I got to get some off air fulfillment. Yeah, the only thing I got... I hope we all get some off air fulfillment after this is done. Count me in. Yeah, the only thing I know is I know how the movie night went because Dawson listened to it and then just told me verbatim everything that happened. So I feel like I was there. Yeah. But you guys did the sum of all fears. You know, I'm just going to read a quick comment here because movie junk of SLC commented about Bridget Moynihan saying that is right. She was quite a fox back in the day. Who would argue that? We were talking about PBM. Chris, what's PBM? That'd be Hattie B's. When I was home with my mom, we were looking for a movie to watch and I'm like, let's watch the sum of all fears. I'd never seen it all the way through. And we watched it and I got two words. Boring. Wow. Did not enjoy way too fucking long. I bet. It would have been an interesting perspective to have in total counterpoint of the three of us talking about how great it is. Well, we have seen some stinkers and it is joyful to me. It's prideful that our movie clubs are more entertaining than the actual movie we're talking about sometimes. I will say that that has definitely improved the format of these movie clubs because we used to do it live during the movie. And then the person during these stinkers would have to just watch us all just suffering in real time for like 90 minutes. But now, like you said, Chris, you don't even necessarily even have to have seen the movie. We just fucking chat and make each other laugh for an hour like any other episode. Yeah. And I'm based off a movie junkies comment talking about how delicious bullet is. I don't know why you guys are talking about my food when I'm not there. Dude, I used to bring bullet to school in elementary school. For those who don't know, it's a fertilized duck egg that I mean, it has all the all the stuff in it. You wash it down. Sometimes the beak. Right. Correct. I mean, you don't look inside. You're just you're just I'm not saying you look. That's really the selling point that I want for my food. Don't look at it. Just see it. Yeah. Is it a pop it in your mouth and get it over with kind of thing? Overall, I was one bite like the second grade when I did this. So like I would bring it to I would bring it to class. And I didn't know what I was eating. I was just just crack it open. Drink the juice. Put some salt in the juice. Oh, the juice is the best. You got a lot of sauce. What kind of sauce are you putting in there? My mouth is. The juice is the best part. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sometimes you got to wonder if the juice is worth the crack. And it is in that case. But yeah, thanks for commenting movie junkie. I'll get some more comments later in the show. But I can I'll agree with you, Chris, because I've smoked crack. That's nice. I was waiting for that, Dawson. I was hoping you were going to figure out a way to pick up on that. I don't know why that's why you're not a spokesperson for more things to us. I mean, Chuck Nibbles. Yeah, but we got to get you more. That could be your line. I got to branch out a little bit. I got crack. I should try cigarettes. That could be your let's get ready to rumble. You know, just trademark it and then just have big events and for big companies just bring that in. Move over, Bruce Buffer. Yeah. They'll just put you in movies and all the yeah, it could be the next best thing. Just everything. All right. All right. Look, we got we do have a lot to get into. I do have some parenting advice that I'm requesting from Kalen and Gary. And I also want Dawson and Matt's advice as well, just from an outsider's perspective of how I should have handled things. But I've been taking my kid to the park. It's a good way for him to get his energy out. I'm pro park. I love parks. Love me. The park today. See, so far, this sounds like the relationship I have on my dogs. Yeah, to enjoy going to the park, like one of the get some energy out. Yeah. And you meet a lot of other of other parents. Yeah. You know, I'm anti-par. You know, oh, you're constantly telling them, don't do that. Don't. Yeah. And also don't park here. Yeah. Is another thing. Dawson Dawson just likes to go on. I don't I don't I'm not I'm not a big fan of parks unless I like parks if they're empty. I guess I'm not a fan of people. Yeah, I would think as a crack smoker, you would spend quite a lot of time in parks. But maybe that's why I need to be empty. It's all different these days. You don't get crack on the corner anymore. Wow. You text the dealer and then you meet inside. Right. Everybody's safe. Times have changed. Yeah. All drugged out cell phones now. You got to come down by my office. You can absolutely get it on the corner. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wherever you want. Yeah. There's no law there. So I do. And I love parks, too. I mean, a lot of major life events that I've had happen have happened in parks. And so, yes. Like what? My earliest memories have happened in my home. Like what? Dude, I'll tell you this. First kiss meet up. First broken arm. No, I broke my arm in the driveway playing hockey. First hand job. Drop kick a street hockey puck. All right. Let's let's keep moving here. Let's keep moving. Anyway, wait, you broke your arm trying to kick a hockey puck. Yeah. Wow. Dude, I used to play hockey. Are you wearing roller blades? Yes. OK. Yes. Of course. I'm just making sure you play hockey on without the roller blades. That's why I'm asking, Caitlin. Shoes and you broke your arm trying to kick something. I would have some follow ups. No, I was big on the blades. Big blader like Matt. You and Matt should get together. You one of those Segway scooter things. You want roller blades? We'll see. We'll see who bails first. I'm I am not exaggerating that my after school ritual was going home, putting in the VHS of D2 Mighty Ducks Part 2 and and watching it really just to the part where they round the crew. They round up the old crew. Yeah. The cold open big blading scene. And and then I would go out and start start rollerblading and then go in the driveway, practice a few knuckle pucks to tell you got it right. And then and then one day I was frustrated. It was one of those pucks. Gary would know this. It's like a street puck with like the three little balls, balls in the middle. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I know these two orange with black balls. They never worked as well as they were supposed to, but everyone wanted them because they looked cool. They looked cool. It is like, yeah, basically just had little little balls in there so it would be able to supposedly slide. You would always end up getting a pebble in one of the balls. So that ball wouldn't spin so that the puck would never go in the direction it was supposed to because only two of the balls were spinning. And the third one was like basically like stopping the puck. Yeah. And then they get like flat spots. It wasn't smooth. It wasn't really made for the streets. But I mean, you know, that was the times back then. And yeah, I remember just taking the puck and really frustrated and trying to drop kick it in roller blades, trying to, you know, just launch that thing. I'll Jack Black and Anchorman to Will Ferrell's dog. And yeah, and just went a little too hard. And I'll bring up another movie, The Replacements, the way he like that that kicker. Forget his name. Just as I believe the character's name was Seamus. Yeah, Seamus, the way Seamus. Nice ball. I mean, not that I know that movie by heart or anything. RIP Gene Hackman, by the way. Yeah. The Hackman. I'm sorry. Real fast. Gene Hackman looked like the same age for like 45 years. And then you see the last picture of him before he died. I would not. A hundred thousand dollars on the table. I would not have been able to tell you that was Gene Hackman. Well, he retired for so long. He didn't, you know, I know. I'm just saying I feel like he looked about 68 from the time he was about 41 until the time he retired at about 85. And then all of a sudden he's 95 and he looks unrecognizable. Yeah. I just I've never seen that was a very stark difference. I agree. It was it was kind of alarming how different he he looked in that picture. But look, we'll get into Gene Hackman a little if you guys want to talk, Gene. But oh, yeah. But let me let me just circle back. So I end up breaking my arm. My brother saw it all happen when you break your arm. And this maybe this is why I have such a bad experience watching people break their bones. If it's pretty traumatizing to the point where like you just know it broke, like you just know. And I remember my brother saw and he just came up to me like you look concerned, but really just came up the point and laugh at me. And when you have a broken arm and a guy just pointing and laughing at you, it's humiliating. It's infuriating. It's traumatizing. This is your brother. Oh, yeah. You see, I broke my arm. He just saw me eat crap. So all right. Yeah. My my fingers swelled up. My hand looked like when Howie Mandel blows into a latex glove for that one bit. Like that's what my hand looked like. And I was like, all right. And I was like, all right. So then end up having a pretty crazy broken wrist to where it was like offset. And that day he had to like push the bones back together. And it was the worst, easily the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. And and, you know, I've had heartbreak in high school. So you can tell how much that really hurt. And and so I yeah, I've got vivid memories of me breaking my arm, playing while blading. Anyway, love me some parks, though. And and this could explain your overall dislike of hand trauma. It could. Yeah, I think you could. If we want to if we want to raise your origin story, you know, if you want to trace it back, it could. I've I've had two traumatic hand experiences. If you can see in I don't know if it'll focus. I mean, I could probably get it to focus a little bit here. You're focusing. Yeah. I mean, this is not going to be worth the payoff, is it? No, you can't see it anyway. That came out pretty quick. Actually, I have I have about it's it's like a almost a two inch scar in between my thumb and my index finger right here. And that is from when I was a kid. I loved me some frozen bananas. And for some crazy reason, did you like frozen bananas for like having a frozen banana now or like if you wanted a regular banana later? I wanted the cold, the cold frozen banana, you know, chocolate dipped even better. I wish I was fucking one one hundredth as funny as Mitch Hedberg. I could have a career like I was great. He was he was incredible. Anyway, so I wanted a frozen banana. My mom's like, I froze some bananas for you. Now, look, I love my mom. She's brilliant. She she raised three kids as a single parent. Able to give us everything we ever wanted. And I respect her dearly. She's she's honestly just incredible. This is not Patreon. What are you doing? I like what you're building. I like what you're building. I'm going to build it like she is just incredible, truly amazing. I don't know how she did what she accomplished, what she was able to accomplish, raising three kids by herself. I got ZZ Top Song, dude. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, while having the successful career as an immigrant from the Philippines, who that's a that pays. Yeah, dude, she got she that was her career being an immigrant. Yeah. But she also became a nurse to any side hustle as a nurse. Smart, smart. You got to have that side hustle. But I mean, shit, dude. I mean, what are the what are the hours? So she's like, I froze some bananas for you there in the freezer. Go get them. And I go and the bananas are in the freezer with with the peel on. And I've never froze bananas before. Her banana, she just threw them in the freezer. She's like, go get it. And, you know, look, I'll be honest, we're Filipino frozen bananas are not our thing. We don't we don't do that. That's not our thing. We eat duck eggs. All right. That's what I brought to school. I never brought frozen banana to school. So I'm thinking, all right, well, better get this peel off the banana. So I knew where the knives were. I just got to cut this peel right off. Oh, God. I am in I am in second grade. A lot of stuff happened to me in second grade. The broken arm thing was like in fifth grade. But and I go to the counter and I'm holding the banana at the counter and I'm trying to cut it with like a butter knife because that's the only those are the only knives that really available to me. Like the standard with your standard flatware, not like a steak knife, but that other knife that they give you that you're like, all right, this is kind of a JV knife. It's kind of weak, but it's too it's not sharp. Yes, it is a butter knife. But may I applaud your use of the word flatware? Thank you. I'm impressed by that. Hey, I'm cultured. I'm cultured. And so I'm trying to I first heard that word when I was like 47. Yeah. Yeah. And I was always impressed by it. Simply because of the person who used the word flatware so eloquently in a conversation. And this person was cultured and this person was successful. You know, the you know, the great person who said flatware had a British accent. I've placed flatware could have been British, could have been British, could have been cockney. Caitlin, do they say that? That's an ugly language. Could have been Australian. Could have been Australian. Could have been an Australian saying flatware. It wasn't Australia. We all know it was definitely the British. And as a British person, I can honestly say this is the first time I'm hearing of this word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Caitlin. Good. I know British culture. They started. You had a good run. They definitely. Yeah. I didn't make it to 47, but welcome to life after flatware, dude. Everything changes now. Well, they call apartments flats. And then they do. And then what do you call the silverware in those set of apartments? Flatware. Oh, yeah, I don't think they have anything to do with each other. Yeah. No, they're really on. They are perfectly correlated. So I have the banana and I'm holding it and I'm trying to saw it off with this super JV weak butter knife. It's not working. And I think, OK, I'm just going to start stabbing it. So I get the knife and I start stabbing this banana. Now, this banana has been out of the freezer for a little bit, so some condensation has formed at the top and you got to stop with the visual display. The focus is terrible and I can't fucking hear you because you're blocking the microphone. I got this. I'm enunciating and I'm some stabbing this banana. Chris pulled the armrest out of his car. I do. I'm making it look like a banana. I'm stabbing it for all of you who are just listening to the audio version. I have props. Yes, I am using props and I'm stabbing this banana. Looks like you're jerking off a pen. And then eventually I go at an angle to where the knife slips on the banana and just comes straight in here and goes into my hand and stabs my hand. I'm going to throw up. Oh, you want to talk? This is where my hand trauma came from. All right. Stabs my hand, goes about a quarter of the knife in and I'm all by myself in the kitchen. I don't know what's going on. It's like, oh boy. And you don't know what's going on. Does that happen a lot when you're all alone in the kitchen? Like, what the fuck is that thing that keeps food cold? I don't know what's going on. It's so shocking that I don't even feel it. Right. Right. You're just like in shock. Oh God. So I take the knife out. I just rip the knife out and I am looking now inside my hand. I remember it vividly. I'm looking inside my hand because I can see this and the blood hasn't started yet. So I'm just looking like, oh my God. And I'm just looking in my hand and all of a sudden this blood just starts gushing out everywhere and I start screaming and crying. And yeah. And that's why I have this big scarf. So maybe that's why. Hey, Kailin, remember 20 minutes ago when Chris said you wanted parenting advice? I do. Anyway, that's probably where my hand trauma stems from. Now back to the park. I've been taking my kids to the park and he's a very sweet boy. Look, I am biased, but I can tell you he's a very sweet boy. Very nice, nice kid. And he's very friendly to all the kids. He says hello. He says hi. I mean, that's pretty much all he can really, you know, conversationally. That's all he that's as far as he gets. But but he enjoys talking to the other kids. And there's this girl there. I've never seen her before. She's probably a year or two older than him. I would say old, maybe even three years. She's she's a young, but she she's all over the place. She's running. She sees him. My kid goes, hello. Just gives him a weird glare and just keeps moving on. All right. Fine. You know, nobody has to respond to him. He doesn't care. I don't care. Whatever. And then my kid decides to play with one of those like little wheels that you spin in the playground off on one of the levels of the park. And she goes up there and she pushes him away to spin the wheel. And basically she's bullying him every single part of the park where he wants to go play with. She gets in front of him to do to use it and doesn't let him touch it. And then she goes up to her dad and goes, hey, I don't like that kid. I don't like that boy. And starts pointing at my kid and the dad doesn't even look up from his phone. OK. And now she is following and harassing my kid. And it's not she's not my I don't know what to say to her. I'm like, hey, man, let's just go over here. We'll go. We'll just do our own thing here. And he's like, but we have to share. My kids like, but share. You taught me to share. And now I'm like, oh, my God, you're questioning the values of the kids. You're questioning the values that I have instilled in you already because of this of this of this girl who I mean, I'll be honest, under my breath, I called her a lot worse than girl. And and I'm just looking at the dad just glued to his phone the whole time. Just sitting there. She's going up to him, telling him how much she hates my kid. And then just proceeds. So I don't want him touching anything in this park. No. And goes up like, no, you can't have that. No, you can't use that. No, this is mine. No. And just telling my kid no to where everywhere I take him to the park, she's following him to harass him. Now, I don't know what to do. I don't know this dad. He's obviously checked out. Yeah. This kid. What's the dad like physically? If this is what I think, is there a large group of dads? Yeah, that's true. But is there a large group of dads taking their kids to the park? Yeah, there is, actually. I think it's I think this is non-existent, non-existent when I was a child. I think this is a way for you just to get your kids energy out and just let them go. Dads don't. I mean, yeah, I'm trying to be careful here. Let's get you. You try to get them to nap time. That's all you're trying to do as a father really is in those first few years is get your child to fall asleep. Right. It's not even just nap time. It's like, I mean, my kids are at a point now where they won't even take a nap. But they need that energy needs to be out by the time it's nighttime. So right now, it's nap time. You got to go run them. Right. But I see a lot of park. You got to run your kids. I see a lot of dads there. I take the I take the dog for a walk. But you guys, you guys seriously have to run your children. They usually run themselves, which is. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully that's good. They can be self-sustaining. I guess a park is a pretty good space for that. Good space. Yeah. And a lot of dads do take that. And I and I bet it's just, you know, it's just like getting your kids to go to the park. It's just, you know, it's just like an easy thing to just take your kids and you don't have to think it too hard about what an activity you have to do. They'll have. And I actually when I took my kids today, it was mostly dads that were there. Yeah. Pretty much all dads. Maybe it's a time of day thing, but yeah. Are you guys smoking crack while you're watching your kids in the park? We have shifts. We have shifts. So like two guys. I like to leave the kid in the car thing. Go score. Yeah. Now, Chris, I actually take a little bit of the opposite stand here. I think you should not be resisting this. I think you need to let it happen. This, this guy, he's raising a strong independent women. There you go. Respect all women. I didn't think about that. Yeah. Your son is going to have a long life ahead of him and dealing with women like this. So better get used to it now. Yep. Right. Right. I'm just saying he just learned what sharing was. You know what? That's a fun thing for people who I'm given. I'm given given Matt Fondelier an award that has never been given out before. But the great the award is the greatest thing ever said on a podcast award. I I love that. I need I'm going to need. And I said, have that scripted out. But yeah, we'll get it on a plaque. I was that was the greatest thing ever said in a podcast. So Kaylin and Gary, do you have any objection to Dawson giving Matt the award during this parenting? You didn't answer Gary's question. What's Gary's question? Thank you. Can you repeat it, Gary? What's the dad like physically? He looks like he can't maybe older than Kailin, but like the physical physicality of Kailin. One ninety. He was older than me. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. So if you were to describe that, Chris, would you say that's really strong, really manly? Like what adjectives would you use to describe that? You know, just don't just say it looks like Kailin. Please let us know. One ninety. Ninety. No, it is tall. Was he attractive? Use words to describe him. All dreamy, attractive. Looks like he can look kind of like Michael Bean. Yeah. So. So anyway, I guess what? Matt's Matt Kailin. You at the park earlier? Yeah, I guess this is my way of confronting you, killing your daughter was such a beatch. Anyway, so it honestly upset me. So it ruined my day. I'm seeing this. And you're right, Matt, he's going to go through this a lot. There's going to be a lot of this kind of stuff, not even with just women, but just with other human beings. And I get that. But if you want an actual answer to this question, I have it. Excuse me. I think you're a warden. Please, please proceed. I think you're a warden. Sit down. I will concede that your answer is much better of an answer in terms of entertainment. But I have kind of seen this behavior with my kids and I'm not the one to do it. But I've seen how Amy reacts in this situation. And as someone who teaches kids and special needs kids, as much as you want to go up to the parent first, you want to like go up to the kid and your kid when they're together and tell them in like a friendly manner, hey, we don't do that. We share this. And you like do it in the kid voice. And that's how you do it without making the parent angry, but also telling the kid like, hey, fucking knock it off. Okay. So Kaylin is right. But I think that there is a tactic that is available to you exclusively in terms of the people on this podcast, Chris, that you really need to keep in your back pocket. If you're as heated up about this, as it sounds like you got, I think you need to play the race card and you accuse that little. What races the little girl doesn't matter. It kind of does it. Well, let me, I mean, Chris, I'll tell you, Kaylin's advice. Kaylin's advice is great advice. If you want the guy to think you're a fucking pussy, I disagree. Oh, very disagree. I think it's right. I think that I agree. My wife is better at it than I am. But that is the most effective way to do it. If the other parent is not going to engage at all, then the only way for you to really handle it and is being adult, be a parent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is to get in there and you know, well, if you're not going to handle this shit, I am pretty much parent mode. Get in there. Now you have to parent to child, two children, because I'll guarantee you this fucking Michael Bean looking motherfucker at the kid park. He's an actor. And right now he's failing as acting as a father. Don't plug anything right now. I didn't say the name. Yeah. So these kids are just just playing about and and their dad's over on his phone playing with his Yamaha guitar. And yeah, you're right. Look, Jenny was there too. And so I had somebody to talk to and really call this girl names under my breath. And she agreed 1000 percent. I mean, this is it was pretty appalling how this girl was acting. So it was nice to have that validation at least. But all right, I'll try the sing songy double just the louder kind of as if I'm a teacher. You don't even before you even get to that point, because I've been at the park with my kids when I mean, it doesn't I don't think I've been getting bullied like as bad as that happens. But if I don't really not really vibe in the way the other kids are playing with their like, I'll go over there and like stand there like I'll just make my presence known. Like this is my kid and I'm going to watch him and they can kind of feel it. They can kind of sense. All right. I'm going to maybe back off a little bit. The fact that you growl when they get too close. It's really weird. Yeah. Yeah. You start peeing on the swings. Smart. Yeah. That's Dawson's style. I mean, like you got to mark your territory. The factory system is not as advanced as canines or felines. So when we pee on swings and slides, other kids don't usually get the point until they've actually sat in the P noted. Yeah. And can confirm as well. Our kids, which reminds me that'll be a shit. I did. Oh, God. Or but what did I do? What did I do? Did I be or did I sit in it? We know you did both. That'll be a shit I did as a kid. We all know you did. Get the Patreon, baby. Get the Patreon. Well, thanks for your advice. I think I think I'm going to just because Kaelin has had some recent interactions that are similar to this. I will try to heed his advice most and make my presence known. Exactly. Once Kaelin said what he said, I was done. I just sat down. All right. Well, speaking of our kids, too, I know Gary, you took Gary Jr. for the experience of a lifetime. Well, it's going to be multiple of these experience because this is you basically begun a yeah. I opened Pandora's box and I took my son for the first time to Benihana. So before the mic heated up, you were going to be sitting in the P note. Mike heated up. Gary was teasing us like guys, I did something with my son. He's never done it before. I want to talk about it. And yeah. And everybody already knew it was Benihana. Dawson guessed it right away. I really wanted I wish we had that on recorded because it was pretty incredible stuff. But this is after the Oscars. It was actually during the Oscars. We you know, I was the best time to get a seat at Benihana. Right. I gotta be honest with you, Dawson. It was pretty light. It's not. It was pretty lit. It was OK. It was the first time that I've ever that I can remember going to Benihana and there were empty seats at the table. There was my three people and then there was another three, three person family. And then there were two empty seats in between us. And I don't think I've ever done that before. Like I have many stories of extended wait times at Benihana, even with reservations when they're waiting for the right combination to make sure they can fill that whole table. So this was this was a first for me. But yeah, we took him. He he loved it. He was not a fan of the 20 or 30 minute wait where you get the soup and you get the salad and there is no show. And he called me a liar because there was he said that there's no show and they don't cook in front of you. And they just brought you that soup and salad. And that's definitely not how you sold this. I felt so betrayed like he brought me here to eat salad. He was pissed. He literally called me a liar. You know what to do in that in that situation is you bully him like that little girl would bully Chris's kid. Yeah, I called him a racist. Everything he was doing smart, smart. But you know, we did try to sort of prepare him for this because it's you know, it's an unconventional experience. It's not until you've been, you know, for us, it's old hat. We've all done this a million times. You know what the experience is like. But I tried to sort of prepare him for it. And it was a combination of like, you know, it's a little different and a little bit of, you know, trying to hype him up and sell him. And you know, what's the big selling point that you're going to sell a five year old on anyone? Well, they throw food or the onion volcano. Right. Exactly right. I mean, okay, the onion volcano. And eventually out came our chef. He introduces himself. He starts doing the thing he's cooking. He's throwing the rice on there. He's got a yada. And my wife announces that she's going to the bathroom and he announces he wants to go with her and he missed the volcano. Oh no. And I don't think he, I, I've videotaped it, which was a little uncomfortable, I think for the other group at my table, because it's sort of impossible to not have them in the shot. I tried my best, but I had to get this video because if he came back and accused me of being a liar once again about the volcano, I needed to have video evidence. I was not going to call him a racist. The second. So you took a video of the table next to you. Interesting. My table, Matt, and it was for a five year old, just like anyone filming at a restaurant should be doing it for now. I got to say, I know I'm not to question your, your parent habits or your, you know, what you tried to do here about parenting. But I think you could have leaned into what I would have done in the situation, which is as soon as your wife and kid get up, you got to lean into the chef and go, can you like, wait a minute till you do the onion volcano show? Just wait till they get back, please. Now just like that. Wait, Matt. So are you saying that you're going to ask the people at the restaurant to wait a little bit before serving your food? That's right. That's what I'm saying. Liberally inconvenience, the chef and the other diners just out of selfishness for your five year old. I, Matt, I know I have no questions, no follow ups under no circumstances. Would that have ever crossed my mind? I don't understand. Why not? What's the difference? I can't back you up on this one or have them do it again. All right. They're back now. Do you do the thing? Would you do that, Matt? If you went to Benihana and you're like, I don't want, I don't want any of those onions hitting the grill till I'm done with my miso soup. Yeah, dude. And if you can't do that, if you can't do that, I want to see Benny. Yeah, I got some things to say to Benny. Yeah. It must be a nightmare for you, Matt. They make that food and just serve it when they choose. And you're normally just filled with everything on the plate by the end of it. Like you can't fast enough to keep up with how quickly they serve the food at Benihana. You know how Chris spent 20 minutes at the beginning of this podcast explaining his origin story of how his trauma began. You've just summed it up right there, my friend. So many days at Benihana, just food coming and coming and coming. Someone just pace it out. The House of Horrors for Matt. Yeah. Next time, Gary, undersell. You got to undersell everything, dude. You got to aim low all the time. Get your. And then everything is like, holy shit, dude. When dad's around, fucking magic happens. Well, I just like, hey, let's really go get some dinner. And then the guy makes a fucking volcano. And you're like, what do you think? We took them. You don't mention the volcano. You don't mention the heart. You don't even mention the fun egg trick. You just go. They make the food in front of you. And that's it. And you let him be surprised by the rest. And if the show's not good. Yeah. I'll be honest. I did. The one. The only thing that I told him, especially and almost exclusively undersell Benihana. Well, it didn't really matter because at the end of it, he told me that the experience was a 100 out of 10. So you're fine. Best with Benihana. And I'm very happy. Father of the year. What's that? I said, did you ask for your apology then? I let it slide. He's young. I know what are you going to do? But I have a two story Benihana opening very close to my house in the very near future. So I'm very excited that he liked it because I know we will be going back. I will tell you that the experience as Benihana, which sounds like it was a fun, delightful evening for you and your family with one child is much different when you have two children. Oh, I can imagine. The amount of chaos that ensues between four people, two parents, two kids, the soups, the salad, all the food that it's nonstop shuffling of plates. It's nonstop scooping. It's nonstop things getting dropped on the floor. It is chaos. It is not. It sounds to me when you get to that level. It sounds to me like a short form documentary chaos at Benihana. I want to see that. I will watch that and I will narrate that for free. Make it listening Netflix. Let's do it, dude. Yeah. And you get a camera crew at Benihana. Stop. Stop. It's happening. I encourage Matt to film more Russian. Matt, you're in, dude. We're doing this. Let's do it. All right. Well, anyway, I'm glad that Gary Jr. had such a good time. And I mean, you're going to get that second story. But you're going to top floor, right? First time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I request the upper floor, please. What does it matter? What do you mean? There's no windows. What does it matter? Have you ever had Benihana upstairs? Thank you, Gary. Thank you. Because I haven't and I will very soon. You got to go very much. It's like a bunk bed. If you get a bunk bed, you're going to request bottom bunk every time. No, the reason you want to bunk, but it's so you can see what it's like to get that top bunk until you get old enough. Wild experience until you get old enough. Yeah. Then at one point you get old enough and be like, you know what, dude, I'm not climbing to bed. I'm falling into bed and you make somebody else take it. There's a reason that every downtown has a restaurant that's on the rooftop floor of a skyscraper. I mean, you got to eat it out. That doesn't. You got to eat it out, dude. Yeah. I will not hear otherwise. You get altitude baby. The way to go. It's called out of food. Out of that's it. That's it. I hear by the award. You said on a podcast award. If anyone ever asks what this what this podcast is about, just say it's a bunch of dudes like shortening things into words. Yeah. Just awarding things to each other. We need a breathing. Yeah, I dig it. Portia sneeze. Yeah. Portia sneeze. All right. Let's see a couple of comments before we get out of here. You guys down? What's happening? We're doing comments. There we go. Let's see some comments real quick. It's a boy singing. Oh, right. These are all comments delivered to us by you, the listeners. Yes. There are a couple of ways to give us comments where we can read and react to your musings as well. First off is joining our Patreon. It's five bucks a month minimum. You get an extra episode a week along with ad free episodes and opportunities for meetups and movie clubs and things like that. We talked about earlier. So please join our Patreon. And that extra episode is recorded pretty much consecutively. Yes. Like a 10 minute pee break. And I'm only on three beers. Like I said, he's getting there. I'm only on three beers. I'm an early slur. Dawson, whatever gets us back. I'm three claws in right now. So we'll raise it. This next show is going to be fucking great, dude. Just pay five bucks for this show. It's going to be slurly. At this rate, we'll be recording Patreon in 15 minutes. You can hear what Dawson sounds like on seven beers by the end because I only have seven. OK, so yeah, let's let's raise ration them. Now, another way to leave comments is by joining our Facebook group. And that is free. And it's a wonderful community. We started this few years back and it's always growing, which we love. All you have to do is go to Facebook dot com slash groups slash Bobo boy army worldwide LLC. Then answer a few questions. We might let you in very easy. And my favorite place on the net. So let's do a quick comment from the Facebook group. This is Jacob Morales. He says I have a weird question. And he says my friend put hot sauce on his mashed potatoes. What say you guys? And the choice. I don't hate it. I'm not. I'm OK with this. Yeah, choices are. I don't hate hot sauce can go on everything and anything. Hot sauce is only good for meat dishes or hot sauce is an apology for poorly made dishes. OK, the second two are insanity. Whoa, it's a wide gap. And that's that's the reason why I voted for hot sauce can go on anything. But if one of the choices was, are you are you a psychopath? I would have chosen. Are you a psychopath? Yeah, never in my life will I put unless mash like if you ever had a mashed potato taco, they're good in Mexico. You get a carrot taco. You got to stay at somebody's Nana's house. But I was vegan potato tacos, carrot tacos and potato tacos. Are the fucking thing. For the love of Christ. It sounds like there's a lot. That's the only that's the only way you're allowed to put hot sauce on mashed potatoes. It's gravy, butter or and either or nothing else. I've spoken. This poll is missing at least one. As as the ruler of the lands. Out of as the Reven of Castle Crust. This poll is at least one and probably two options between the first one and the last two, because the last two are just utter insanity. Hot sauce is only for me. What about egg? Yeah, hot sauce is for anything you want to put it on. That was the only logical answer. So, yeah, everyone who answered otherwise is probably a psychopath as well. Well, 81% said hot sauce can go on everything or anything. And then 17% say hot sauce is an apology. And then 2% said hot sauce is only for good for meat dishes. So I want to say you guys put hot sauce on. I have an answer and I did. Ironically, the meat dish. Mine is not mine. Well, mine sounds like a meat dish. It's animal style fries. And I put sriracha on that to Kailin's dismay. I haven't even thought of doing this before. I will be blowing my mind right now. Fucking right quick. That sounds pretty good, Kailin or Chris sriracha on animal style fries. Oh, yeah, it's chef's kiss. How do we feel about the animal style fries? I feel as though I love the animal style fries, but I feel like the amount of spread and grilled onions they give you makes it three bites. Makes it three bites of animal style grilled fries or animal style fries followed by just french fries. All right. That's why you get extra spread. I'm on rookie move, dude. Kailin, I 100%. You know, I'm not. And then you get extra spread packs on the side because there's still not enough on there. Kailin, come on. We live together. You know, I'm not going to live in this world where I have three bites of animal style fries and just move on. The way they make. Honestly, I kind of like it because you get that top layer of animal style and then you get that bottom layer of just regular fries where you go. Yeah, but you miss the spread. I can still just do the spread. You cover those things by the time you get them home there. Soggy. Yeah. That's what you're going to get them. Yeah. And I also as as a fry connoisseur claiming it now, TM, I like to be in control when I'm eating my fries. I don't want you to decide how much sauce or whatever I'm going to have on my fries. Usually I just eat the fries with salt and I just always ask for more salt, which is why I'm now on a heart medication. But all right. Well, here's the thing. And before before I make this point, let me explain to the Culver's and what a burger enthusiast out there, what animal style fries are there in and out fries with. No, I know. I had. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With melted cheese, spread and grilled onions. They're smothered. Smothered. They're smothered with with. Yeah. And it's awesome. Now I'll take a double double animal style, but the fries I respect in and out fries because there is a dude making 1750 and he's in the first part of the building. You see, as you pull up through the drive-through, you know what that dude is? He's grabbing potatoes and he's putting them in a potato cutter and he's pulling down this large clamp and shooting the potatoes through French fry blades into a bin that then is going to be cooked and served to you. Yeah. I think it's a beautiful thing. And those fries deserve. Yeah. As a hero. So. And I like to be in control of my fries. Well, here's the thing. That's why they offer you the animal style option, which you can do for your burgers. You can do for your fries, which they add a little extra judge and flavor and intensity to your meal. And DOS, when you order animal style, you're not ordering the food animal style. It's because you're freaking animal and you want them to do all that stuff to your food. OK, you're the one that's the animal. So, yeah, if you're ordering animal style fries, the fries are never really thought of it. Yeah. So that's why that's why you're just an animal like I am. And I'm a freaking animal. I have some follow ups here. Because of the aforementioned sort of lack of animal contents on the fries, are you adding more spread to this? And if so, are you doing that before you apply your sriracha? I need to know how to do this correctly. OK, this is this is going to be look, the master class. I'm not proud of a lot of things. I know I'm not proud of a lot of things. I'm so glad I asked the question. Like this is I need to know how to do this right. It's weird because Kailin used to give me so much crap for putting sriracha on my animal style fries. So I'm excited that he's now turned a corner has since forgotten his true opinion about it. I have. I have not remembered this at all. All right. But more to the point, putting hot sauce on mashed potatoes is absolutely insane unless it's in a taco. It's strange, but I'm going to try it the next time I'm eating mashed potatoes. I'm fine. Oh, yeah. To answer the poll, I'm fine. I don't like it. I mean, I wouldn't personally do it. But if you want to do it, it's all good with me. Not at my table, dude. Can what you do. So what I do is I ask for an extra packet of spread, which is about one tenth of what Kailin asked for. Is that what you call it? Spread. Yeah. Do you say it in a really sexy voice? Yeah. Can I get a that's my regular voice? That's my regular voice. They can have an extra pack of spread. And yeah, but people somehow think my voice is really sexy when I ask. It's really weird. So I get the spread. And now what I do, Kailin, is I take the fries that are in the box because they give it to you in a different kind of box. It's usually a closed box. So you open the box up and now you have two little boats of of where you can put the fries and you have the little fry tray in the box. I take the fry tray and I turn it upside down to where now I'm just seeing dry fries at the top and the cheese and the onions at the bottom. And I put the spread on that part. And then I take the sriracha and I put that on top of that and then I stir it up. And now each fry is evenly coated with sriracha, a little extra spread, grilled onions and cheese. And each bite is better than the last. And I look forward to my mouth thinking about it. So, yeah, I'm a freaking animal. Is there a problem with the melted cheese and the onions then just sticking to the bottom of the boat that you flipped it onto? Only if you're an amateur. Yeah. OK. Dude, Chris brings up a pretty smart point. Yeah. I've been working live events for a long time and there's catering, like basic catering. There'll be that thing at chicken cutlets or something or, you know, Philly cheese steaks or hot dogs. The only thing that was ever consistent in live event catering is the salad. Salad bar. They got all the stuff in the salad bar and you find out early on that you make a bowl of salad and you put all your stuff on it. And then you get a second bowl and you top it and then you marimba shake the salad bowls and then put one underneath and boom, you got to toss salad, bro. Just like that. I'll tell you how to toss a salad. So and I'll tell you in detail. So it all started with McDonald's used to have like these salad shakers. Salad shooter. They used to give you like it was a salad and they basically gave it to you in a cup and you just put the dressing in and then you would shake it like a martini. But the thing about shaking a salad in like a salad, a closed salad case, you got to do the horizontal movement. It's all horizontal. If you go vertical when you shake, you're not going to really spread it. For some reason, it's the horizontal shake that really gets you the extra coating of dressing on each. Yeah, but there's two directions of horizontal. You got to go side to side and then you got to go front and I go front. Yeah, that's right. But as long as on the horizontal axis, I'm more of a you don't want to go vertical. Yeah, you don't want to go vertical because then all your dressing is going to stick to the lid and the bottom of the container. So you're working on two dimensions. You may as well explore all the territory in that vertical. And I'm going to say if you really want to toss a salad right, you got to go front to back inside the side. But I wouldn't I wouldn't go vertical. You guys are pro or anti pepper and Cheney in salads. Dude, I'm so pro. Pepper and Cheney in everything. I'll eat them fish and cheese. I put that in my mashed potatoes. I love pepper and Cheney's. It's like what you do with hot sauce. I was hoping we could add that to our water cooler crest that we're pro pepper and Cheney. Yeah, follow me. Yeah, we're pro brin Cheney. That's pretty good, Matt. All right. No, it wasn't. It's so much funnier. Yeah, you know, let's let's end comments there. Four years is really a sweet spot for math. Apparently. Three. All right. Well, I mean, I can't wait to see the full three. I can't wait to see what four brings us during Patreon. Those are a comment that was our comment. We definitely have more. I'll get to them next week. And thanks everybody for writing in like and join our Facebook group. I mean, Casey Peters needs help with his brake pads and because Chandra has something about mystery movie Mondays that that sounds fun. And, you know, Kathy Lowry is going to Italy and she has a funny meme about about a dog with a chef's hat. And you want to see all this. Join the Facebook group and then our page. And our page runs. We got a lot of great stuff on there as well. Like Don Powell just wrote a comment that's a that starts off with Gary's right. And then he goes on to talk about all this other stuff. We don't read that. We don't need to read that later. So anyway, why don't we go around the horn, get our plugs in and then we'll go ahead and start on Dawson's fourth beer. So I'll start in Austin, Texas. Matt Fondelier, what do you suggest we check out or the audience checks out? Well, you should definitely check out our Patreon, patreon.com slash water cooler. You get the second half of tonight's episode and the ad free, I got to say, is a really, really good option to select. And I'll also just say the movie Wayne's World. I just rewatch that again. God damn, that is just fucking stone cold classic. So good. That's that. That's the other thing I want to pull. How did Wayne's World get back into your life? Your life now? I am oftentimes trying to find like a stupid comedy to watch on a Friday night, and they just don't make those kind of movies anymore. It's very hard to find a great modern comedy. So we've been dipping back to the older classics. We also recently watched The Naked Gun, which I had not seen in a very long time again, just wall to wall. I go for me in that movie. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Love it. I love that you're doing that too. I look to those kind of movies for comfort myself. So, yeah, I recommend everybody do that. All right. Kaylin, what do you suggest people check out? Go check out Just Foolin' About podcast. That's me and my dad's podcast. There's a great new episode out today with the director Adam Wingard, who did the Godzilla vs. King Kong movies. He did Your Next, which is a very fun kind of horror movie. And he has a great gonzo action horror movie coming out later this year produced by a 24 called Onslaught. And my dad get into detail about the two of them working on that movie together. And it's great. It's great interview. It's super fun. Go check it out. Watch it on YouTube. Listen on Spotify. Hell, yeah. Subscribe wherever. Just Foolin' About. Yeah, please go. Go listen that part and support Kaylin. All right. Gary, what are you? Go check out Don Powell in our Facebook group. He sounds like he's got some really good ideas. So I would go read all of his comments. And also you can follow Reasonable Doubt on YouTube. YouTube.com slash reasonable doubt podcast or subscribe anywhere you get podcasts. Me and Mark. Mark keeps promising midweeks. I have absolutely no controls. Don't at me. But Reasonable Doubt podcast on YouTube. And at Patreon you should check out Don Powell. Oh, yeah. Patreon. That too. And he has a lot of opinions there, I think, is what Gary was trying to say too. He lives in really nice stuff on Patreon as well. All right. And yeah, don't at Gary. Das, what about you? Friday night, I'm doing a comedy show at the Ice House. Renegades with Lynn's son. Weekend after that, I'm going to be with Adam and Phoenix. Stage time TBD, but Desert Ridge improv 14, 15th and 16th. I'll at least be there selling merch. And that'll be where you can get to the stickers of me smoking a cigarette. And it just says, dude, classic image. Yeah. All right. They're fun. Get a doll five bucks. Four for 20, five for 20. Make it better. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. Make it better. I was going to say that four for 20 was really a deal. And also, I just want to thank everyone who reached out and everyone did. And thank you. And I appreciate it. And one day I'll respond to all of you. It's just not going to be today. All good. Yeah, we got good people. Kind of is today, actually, if you think about it. I guess, yeah. But anyway, yeah, we got some good people. You just responded to all of them at once. It was kind of the easiest way to do that. Yeah, but it's putting it on them. They got to listen to the podcast. Now I got to search out. Yeah. How about this, Dustin, instead of thanking everybody personally, just send them the link to this show. You know, one of the things that's smart, I like that. Just put a time code. Just put a time code. That's pretty good. Wow. I might actually listen to the show for the first time ever. I mean, you're going to skip to the end and then rewind it. I mean, I won't really listen. You got to listen through and hear out the food. I mean, come on. That's fucking gold. Don't give them a time code. Have them earn it. Also, also about I'm going to say three years ago, you guys ever eat the Vinnie Torter rich ultra fat? I tried it back in the day. You're talking about almond almond butter or whatever. Yeah. Well, I got an old one somewhere. I couldn't find an old one, but I have a recurring delivery of these. And to be honest, what I've eaten today, and this is probably why the alcohol has affected me so fast. I've eaten four of five of Vinnie Torter, which is ultra fat energy. So you get some fucking protein, a broccoli shake, and it, cause I just don't eat unless I feel inspired to cook. You know what I mean? So Vinnie Torter, which is stuff gets me through the day. Just work. I told Vinnie in an email about three years ago, Hey bro, the packaging of these things hits the corners of your mouth. And like, you can't, you're, you're in danger of cutting your lips when you eat these. The next time you manufacture these things, please consider making a smaller opening so you can get your mouth around it. I got my reoccurring. I got my reoccurring and then hung up the phone. I got my recurring delivery from Vinnie Torter rich today. And this is the new packaging. Oh, she, that's the ultra fat Mark two baby. He did it. Nice. These now I'm no longer in danger of cutting my mouth wide open when I eat one of these things. And if you do it wrong, you could, I mean, you got to be really special to make it happen, but it is possible. Yeah. To be clear, you're not supposed to eat the wrapper, right? No, dude, it's it's, it's, it's, it's a mixture of like edible wrapping. You know, you know, when you buy peanut butter and the oil sits at the top, you know, when you buy peanut butter and the oil sits at the top, the, the good kind of peanut butter that you got to really blend. Oh yeah. So these things, these things do separate. So you just mix them up and essentially you're eating peanut butter, but it's from awesome nuts, not garbage nuts. It's almonds. It's almond butter. Yeah. It's good stuff. It's very, it's very good. I have a few of them in my pantry as well. And now you want to throw them out knowing that there's a smaller whole version. So my last plug is for C minus. Here's the number four. Thanks guys. I had to make up because I listened to the shows like eight times. I get it. I didn't get any plugs. You got to catch up. You got to. And if you mathematically times all the times I heard your guys's plugs, kind of feel like I'm owed a few more this time. So thank you. No, it's good. It's good to make it right. And then as for me, please peel your bananas before freezing them. All right. That'll do it for this episode of water cooler. Thank you so much for hanging out with us. We'll be back for patron later this week. We love you. Goodbye.
