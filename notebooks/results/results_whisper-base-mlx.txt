 What a cool love. Ba ba ba. Oh, what a cool love. Breathe into, into, into, into, What a cool love. Ba ba ba. Oh. Hey, welcome to Watercooler. Thank you so, so much for tuning in and hanging out with us. Once again, you know how the show goes. I, Chris Loczamana, kick it with my Corolla digital buds of yesterday year. Philly style. Today all the way in Austin TX, it's Mr. Matt Fondaleer. Hey, brother. Hi, Matt. And then all the way in Long Beach, California, like myself, it's Kaelin Bean. What's going on? Hi, Kaelin. Hey, Chris. And not much is going on except, you know, I'm getting to pod with my good buds. Oh, yeah. Hell, yeah. And then all the way in Orange County, California. It's Gary Smith. Adipana. You know, I think Orange County is getting very close to claiming that saying the way Gary is evolving each time. So you better tell your Texas buddies to step it up, Matt. Go send the message out now. We'll wait. All right. He's gone. And then back making his triumphant return all the way in, he's back in Noho, California. That's right. Mr. Mike Dawson. Yeah, I noticed how you incorporated a little bit of a hand jive into your mouth, Licks, there Chris. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Step it up a bit. You know, I did listen to the show's three times each. Of course. And the movie. But I didn't do the video. Oh, that's a nice one. So that's a nice one. I don't know if that's something new. It's fresh, exciting. It's so inviting to me. Yeah. Yeah. You know how, you know of what is it? Synthesis, Synthesia. What is it called when you see anesthesia? Anesthesia. Anesthesia. I just, I just get super numb when I hear music. And I can't, yeah. My body just, just goes completely crazy because I, I can't, I have no feeling in my nerves. That's right. It's anesthesia. Yeah. And that's what happens when I hear music and when I feel the music, it's just, I can't really numb. It's like someone just shot, shot up a bunch of Novakain into all of my nerves. Yeah. Right. Anyway, I'd be a miserable existence. I gotta say, I gotta say, Dawson's not the only one making a triumphant return. We miss you, Chris, as well for the, the movie club that we did. And we miss you Dawson. It was, it was a hell of a time and, and for the meetup, which I gotta say, I think there are a few people at meetup who can attest that that was one of our spicier meetups. Oh my God. Sure. It really was. That's spicy meetup. Yep. He had to say multiple times, please don't put anything on Reddit. Please. Yeah. I believe my exact thing was if anything that I said in that meetup shows up anywhere on the internet, the meetups are going to change wildly. Wow. Yeah. It was a good time. This is my, and until listen, this is my first time hearing about how spicy this meetup was. So even I myself, this is the only way you could hear. I'm not sure about it because everyone's cool there and we don't record those. So we, we talk a little shit. I, this little two spicy even for me. It was pretty good. But it that way. Yeah. Let's just say Gary was fired up and I might have, you know, yeah. Me. I'm not here. I gotta get some, I ever get some off air fulfillment. Yeah. The only thing I got. Oh, I don't know. I hope we all get some off air fulfillment after this is done. Count me in. I, yeah, the only thing I know is I know how the movie night went because Dawson listened to it and then just told me for bait of everything that happened. So I was there. Yeah. But you guys did the sum of all fears. You know, I'm just going to make a quick comment here because movie junk of SLC commented about Bridget Moynihan saying that is right. She was quite a fox back in the day. Who were you talking about? We were talking about PVM. I'll tell you what's PBM. That'd be had he bees. When I was home, when I was home with my mom, we were looking for a movie to watch and I'm like, let's watch the sum of all fears. I had never seen it all the way through and we watched it and I got two words. Bull ring. Oh, wow. Wow, did not enjoy way too fucking long. I've been an interesting perspective to have in total counterpoint of the story of talking about how great it is. Well, we have seen some stinkers and it is joyful to me. It's prideful that our movie clubs are more entertaining than the actual movie we're talking about sometimes. I will say that that has definitely improved the format of these movie clubs because we used to do it live during the movie and then the person during these stinkers would have to just watch us all just suffering in real time for like 90 minutes. But now, like you said, Chris, you don't even necessarily even have to have seen the movie. We just fucking chat and make each other laugh for an hour like any other episode. Yeah. Based off of movie junkies, it's common talking about how delicious bullet is. I don't know why you guys are talking about my food when I'm not there. Dude, I used to bring bullet to school in elementary school. For those who don't know, it's a fertilized duck egg that I mean, it has all the all the stuff in it. You wash it down. Sometimes the beak, right? Correct. I mean, I don't know. A look inside. You're just, you're just, I don't, I'm not saying you look. That's really the selling point that I want for my food. Don't look at it. Just see it in. It's in the vibing. Yeah. Is it a pop it in your mouth and get it over with kind of thing? Take overall taste. I was in like the second grade when I did this. So like I would bring it to, I would bring it to class and I didn't know what I was eating. I was just, just, I hope, crack it open. Drink the juice, put some salt in there. Oh, the juice. Oh, the juice is the best. You got to look at the salt for you putting in there too. My mouth is water. The juice is the best part. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, sometimes you got to wonder if the juice is worth the crack. And it is in that case. But yeah, thanks for clomenting movie junky. I'll get some more clomets later in the show. Yeah, I can all agree with you, Chris, because I've smoked crack. That's nice. I was waiting for that, Dawson. I was hoping you were going to figure out a way to pick up on that. I don't know why that's not, why you're not a spokesperson for more things, Dawson. I mean, Chuck Nibble's, yeah, but we got to get you more. That could be your life. I got a branch out a little bit. I got crack. I should try cigarettes. That could be your, let's get ready to rumble. You have this trademark kit and then just have big events and for big companies, just turn that in. Yeah, move over brief buffer. Yeah. They'll just put you movies and all the, yeah, it could be the next best thing. Just everything. All right. Look, we got, we do have a lot to get into. I do have some parenting advice that I'm requesting from Kaelin and Gary. And I also want Dawson and Matt's advice as well, just from an outsider's perspective of how I should have handled things. But I've been taking my kid to the park. It's a good way for him to get his energy out. I'm pro park. I love parks. Love me to the park today. See? So far, this sounds like the relationship I have on my dogs. Yeah. We too enjoy going to the park. I like going to the park. Get some energy out. Yeah. And you meet a lot of other, of other parents. Yeah. You know, I'm anti-park. I'm not a big fan of parks unless I like parks if they're empty. I guess I'm not a fan of people. Yeah. I would think as a crack smoker, you would spend quite a lot of time in parks. But maybe that's why I need to be empty. It's all different these days. You don't get crack on the corner anymore. You text the dealer and then you meet inside. Right. Keeps everybody safe. Times of change. Yeah. Call the drug ass. That's cell phones now. You got to come down by my office. You can absolutely get it on the corner. Oh, yeah. Where are you at? True. Where are you at? True. Yeah. So, dude, and I love parks too. I mean, a lot of major life events that have happened in parks. And so, yeah, it's like my earliest memories have happened in parks. Oh, my. Dude, I'll tell you this. First kiss. First meetup. First broken arm. No, I broke my arm in the driveway, playing hockey. First hand job. I'm gonna drop kick a street hockey puck. All right. Let's keep moving here. Let's keep moving here. Anyway, dude, you broke your arm trying to kick a hockey puck. Yeah. Wow. Dude, I used to play hockey in my time. Are you wearing roller blades? Yes. Okay. I'm just making sure. You're playing hockey without the roller blades when you're... That's why I'm asking, Caleb. You were just in shoes and you broke your arm trying to kick something. I would have some follow ups. No, I was big on the blades. Big blader. Like Matt. You and Matt should get together. You and one of those segue scooter things. Dude. And you on roller blades. Dude, I will see who fit Bale's first. I am not exaggerating that my after school ritual was good. I was going home, putting in the VHS of D2, Mighty Ducks Part 2. And watching it, really just to the part where they round the crew. They round up the old crew. Because it's a big... Big blading scene. And then I would go out and start rollerblading. And then you know, go in the driveway practice a few knucklepucks until I got it right. And then one day I was frustrated. It was one of those pucks. Scary wouldn't know. It's like a street puck with like the three little balls. A ball's in the middle. Yeah. Absolutely. I know these two. Orange with black balls. They never worked as well as they were supposed to. But everyone wanted them because they looked cool. They looked cool. They're like, yeah, basically just had little balls in there. So it would be able to supposedly slide right in. You would always end up getting a pebble in one of the balls. So that ball wouldn't spin so that the puck would never go in the direction it was supposed to because only two of the balls were spinning. And the third one was like basically like stopping the puck. Yeah, it was. Yeah, and then they get like flat spots. It wasn't smooth. It wasn't really made for the streets. But I mean, you know, that was the times back then. And yeah, I remember just taking the puck and really frustrated and trying to drop kick it in roller blades, trying to just launch that thing. I'll jack black and anchor man to Wilferrell's dog. And yeah, it just went a little too hard. And I'll bring up another movie. The replacement. Maybe like that that kicker. Forget his name. Just. Jamis. Huh? I believe the character's name was Shamis. Shamis. Yeah, the way Shamis nice bowl. I mean, not that I know that movie by heart or anything. RIP Jean Hackman, by the way. Yeah. The dude, you can hack me. I'm sorry, real fast. Jean Hackman looked like the same age for like 45 years. And then you see the last picture of him before he died. I would not $100,000 on the table. I would not have been able to tell you that was Jean Hackman. Well, he retired for so long. He didn't, you know, he just, oh, I know. I'm just saying I feel like he looked about 68 from the time he was about 41 until the time he retired about 85. And then all of a sudden he's 95 and he looks unrecognizable. Yeah. No, I just, I've never seen. That was a very stark difference. I agree. It was, it was kind of alarming how different he looked in that picture. But look, we'll get in a Jean Hackman. Although if you guys want to talk Jean, but, oh, yeah. But let me, let me just circle back. So I ended up breaking my arm. My brother saw it all happen. When you break your arm, and this, maybe this is why I have such a bad experience watching people break their bones. It's pretty traumatizing to the point where like you just know it broke. Like you just know. And I remember my brother saw and he just came up to me. Like he looked concerned, but really just came up to point and laugh at me. And when you have a broken arm and a guy just pointing laughing at you, it's humiliating. It's infuriating. It's traumatizing. This is your brother. Oh, yeah. But you see the thing I broke my arm. He just saw me eat crap. This is okay. All right. Yeah, my fingers swelled up. My hand looked like when Howie Mandel blows into a latex glove for that one bit. Like that's what my hand looked like. And I was like, all right. So then, end up having a pretty crazy broken wrist to where it was like offset. And that day he had like pushed the bones back together. And it was the worst, easily the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. And you know, I've had heartbreak in high school. So you can tell me how much that really hurt. And so I just, yeah, I, that vivid memories of me breaking my arm, playing, well, bleeding. Anyway, love me some parks though. And. And. Explain your overall dislike of hand trauma. It could. Yeah. I think you could. If we want it, if we want to, this is your origin story, you know, if we want to trace it back, it could, I've, I've had two traumatic hand experiences. If you can see in, I don't know if it'll focus, I mean, I could probably get it to focus a little bit here. Focus on me. Yeah. I mean, this is not going to be worth the payoff. Is it? You can't see it. Anyway. That's right. That's kind of, man. Pretty quick, actually. I have, I have about, it's, it's like a, almost a two inch scar in between my thumb and my index finger right here. And that is from when I was a kid, I loved me some frozen bananas. And for some crazy reason, um, did you like frozen bananas for like having a frozen banana now or like if you wanted a regular banana later? Like, a frozen banana now. I wanted the cold, the cold frozen banana, you know, if chocolate dipped even better. I wish I was fucking one hundred this funny as Mitch Hedberg. I could have a career. Like I was great. He was, he was incredible. Um, anyway, so I wanted frozen banana. My mom's like, I've frozen bananas for you. Now, look. I love my mom. She's brilliant. She, she raised three kids as a single parent, able to give us everything we ever wanted. Um, and I respect her dearly. She's, she's honestly just incredible. This is not Patreon. What, what are you doing? I don't know. You're building. No, like you're building. I'm, I'm going to build like she's just incredible. It's really amazing. I don't know how she did what she accomplished, what she was able to accomplish, um, raising three kids by herself. I got ZZ Top Song, dude. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. While, while, while having the successful career as an immigrant from the Philippines, who, that's a, that pays. Yeah. Dude, she got, she, she, that was her career, um, being an immigrant. Yeah. But she also became a nurse too. Uh, anyway, okay. Side hustle as a nurse. Um, smart. Smart. You got to have that side hustle. But I mean, shit, dude. Why me? What are the, what are the hours? Um, so she's like a frozen bananas for you. They're in the freezer. Go get them. And I go. Mm hmm. And the bananas are in the freezer with, with the peel on. And I've never frozen bananas before. Wow. Her banana, she just threw them in the freezer. She's like, go get it. And, uh, you know, look, I'll be honest. We're, we're Filipino frozen bananas are not our thing. We don't, we don't do that. That's not our thing. We eat duck eggs. That's what I brought to school. I never brought frozen banana school. So I'm thinking, all right, we'll better get this peel off the banana. So, um, I never the knives were. I just got to cut this peel right off. Oh, God. I'm in. I'm in second grade. A lot of stuff happened. I mean, second grade. Um, the broken arm thing was like in fifth grade. But. And I go to the counter and I'm holding the banana at the counter. I'm trying to cut it with like a butter knife because that's the only, those are the only knives that really available to me. Like the, the standard, with your standard flatware, not like a steak knife, but that other knife that they gave you that you're like, all right, this is kind of a JV knife. It's kind of weak, but it's too, it's not sharp. Yes, it is a butter knife. But may I applaud your use of the word flatware? Thank you. I'm impressed by that. I'm cultured. I'm cultured. And, uh, so I'm trying to say, I first heard that word when I was like 47. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was always impressed by it simply because of the person who used the word flatware. So eloquently in a conversation and this person was cultured and this person was successful. You know, the, you know, the great person who said flatware had a big shack. I, I, I, I've called the flatware. It could have been British. Could have been British. Could have been Cockney. Caitlin, do they say flatware? I mean, that's an ugly language. Could have been Australian. That way. Could have been an Australian saying flatware. It wasn't Australia. We all know it was definitely the British. And as a British person, I can honestly say this is the first time hearing of this word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Caitlin. Well, I know British culture. They started. Yeah, a good run there. Definitely. Yeah. I didn't make it to 47, but welcome to your life after flatware, dude. Everything changes now. Well, they call apartments flats. And then. And then what are you called the silverware in those set of apartments flatware? Duh. Yeah, I don't think they have anything to do with each other. Yeah, no, they're really. Carry on. They are perfectly correlated. So I have the banana and I'm holding it and I'm trying to saw it off with this super JV week. Better than if it's not working. And I think, okay, I'm just going to start stabbing it. So I get the knife and I start stabbing this banana. Now this banana has been out of the freezer for a little bit. So some condensation is formed at the top. And you got to stop with the visual display. The focus is terrible. And I can't fucking hear you because you're blocking the microphone. I got it. I got this. I got this. I'm an unciating and I'm some stabbing this banana. Chris pulled the armrest out of his car. I do. And he's making it. He can look like a banana. I'm just stabbing it for all of you who are just listening to the audio version. I have props. Yes, I am using props and I'm stabbing this banana. Looks like you're jerking off a pen. And then I've got an angle to where the knife slips on the banana and just come straight in here and goes into my hand and stab my hand. I'm going to throw up. Oh, you want to talk? This is where my hand trauma came from. All right. And then my hand goes about a quarter of the knife in and I'm all by myself in the kitchen. I don't know what's going on. So I'm like, oh boy. And it's just shocking. You know what's going on. Is that happened a lot when you're all alone in the kitchen? Like what the fuck is that thing that keeps food cold? I don't know what's going on. Yeah. It's so shocking that I don't even feel it. You're right. Right. You're just like in shock. Oh, God. So I take the knife out. I just rip the knife out. And I am looking now inside my hand. I remember it vividly. I'm looking inside my hand because I can see this and the blood hasn't started yet. So I'm just looking like, oh my God. And I'm just looking in my hand and all of a sudden this blood just starts gushing out everywhere. And I start screaming and crying. And yeah. And that's why I have this big scar. So maybe that's okay. Remember 20 minutes ago when Chris said you wanted parenting advice? I did. Anyway. Anyway. That's probably where my hand drama stems from. Now back to the park. I've been taking my kids to the park. And he's a very sweet boy. Look, I am biased, but I can tell you he's a very sweet boy. Very nice kid. And he's very friendly to all the kids. He says, hello. He says, hi. I mean, that's pretty much all he can really, you know, as conversationaly. That's all he, that's as far as he gets. But he enjoys talking to the other kids. And there's this girl there. I've never seen her before. She's probably a year or two older than him. I would say older, maybe even three years. She's, she's a young one, but she, she's all over the place. She's running. She sees him. My kid goes, hello. Just gives him a weird glare and just keeps moving on. All right. Fine. You know, nobody has to respond to him. He doesn't care. I don't care. Whatever. And then my kid decides to play at, with one of those like little wheels that you spin in, in the playground, up on one of the levels of the park. And she goes up there and she pushes him away to spin the wheel. And basically she's bullying him. Every single part of the park where he wants to go play with, she gets in front of him to do, to use it and doesn't let him touch it. And then she goes up to her dad and goes, hey, I don't like that kid. I don't like that boy. I start pointing at my kid. And the dad doesn't even look up from his phone because I, okay. And now she is following and harassing my kid. And it's not, she's not mine. I don't know what to say to her. I'm just like, hey, man, let's just go over here. Well, we'll just do our own thing here. And he's like, but we have to share. My kid's like, but share. You taught me to share. And now I'm like, oh my God, you're questioning the values that I have instilled in you already. Because of this girl who, I mean, I'll be honest, under my breath, I called her a lot worse than girl. And I'm just looking at the dad, just glued to his phone the whole time. Just sitting there. She's going up to him, telling him how much she hates my kid. And then just proceeds, I don't want him touching anything in this park. No, and it goes up like, no, you can't have that. No, you can't use that. No, this is mine. No. And just telling my kid no to where everywhere I take him to the park, she's following him to harass him. Now, I don't know what to do. But I don't know this dad. He's obviously checked out. Yeah. This kid. What's the dad like physically if this guy? That's what I'm thinking. Is there a large group of dads? Yeah, that's true. But is there a large group of dads taking their kids to the park? Oh, yeah, there is actually. I think it's, I think it's a non-existent, non-existent when I was a child. I think this is a way for you just to get your kids energy out and just let them go. And dads don't, I mean, I'm trying to be careful here. Yeah, let's get, let's, you try to get them to nap time. That's all you're trying to do as a father. Really is in those first few years is get your child to fall asleep. Right. It's not even just nap time. It's like, I mean, my kids are at a point now where they won't even take a nap, but they need that energy needs to be out by the time. It's nighttime. Right. Right. It's nap time. You gotta go run them. Right. But I do see them at the park. You gotta run your kids. Yeah. I see a lot of dads there. I take the dog for a walk, but you guys, you guys here is after running your children. They usually run themselves, which is a thing. Yeah. Yeah. They can be self-safety. I guess a park point is a pretty good space for that. Good space. Yeah. And a lot of dads, you take there, and I, and I bet it's just, you know, it's just like an easy thing to just take your kids and you don't have to think it too hard about what, and activity you have to do. They'll have, and I took my kids today. It was mostly dads that were there. Yeah. Pretty much all that. Maybe it's a time, maybe it's a time of day thing, but yeah. Are you guys smoking crack while you're watching your kids in the park? Yeah, but we have shifts. Come on. We have shifts, so like two guys, I kind of like leave the kid in the car thing, go score. Yeah. Yeah. Now Chris, I actually take a little bit of the opposite stand here. I think you should not be resisting this. I think you need to let it happen. This guy, he's raising a strong independent woman. There you go. Respect all women. I think about that. Yeah. Your son is going to have a long life ahead of him of dealing with women like this. So better get used to it now. Yep. Right? Right. I'm just saying he just learned what's your way. That's a fine thing for people. I'm giving Matt fondlier an award that has never been given out before, but the great, the award is the greatest thing you ever said on a podcast award. I, I love how Dom is in need. I'm going to need, I have that scripted out, but yeah, dude, we'll get it on a plaque. That was, that was the greatest thing ever said in a podcast. Oh, so Caitlin and Gary, do you have any objection to Dawson giving Matt the award during this parenting section? You didn't answer Gary's question. Oh, what's Gary's question? Thank you. Can you repeat it, Gary? What's the dad like physically? He looks like Caitlin. That maybe older than Caitlin, but like physical physicality of Caitlin. 190? He was older than me. Let me tell you something. So if you were to describe that, Chris, would you say that's really strong, really manly? Like what adjectives would you use to describe that? Oh, yeah. You know, just, just say it looks like Caitlin. Please let us know. 190. 90. No, he's, he's tall. He's attractive. Yeah. He's, he's, he's words to describe him. Tall dreamy attractive. Mm-hmm. Uh, looks like you're going to, you can, uh, you know, look kind of like Michael beam. Yeah. So, um, so anyway, I guess what Matt's, Matt, was it Caitlin? I, I, I, I, I, I guess this is my way of confronting you, Caitlin. Your daughter was being such a b-och. Um, anyway, so it, it honestly, it upset me. So it ruined my day. I'm seeing this. And you're right, Matt, he's going to go through this a lot. There's going to be a lot of this kind of stuff. Not even with just women, but just with other human beings. And I get that. But if you want an actual answer to this question, I have it. Excuse me. Take your award and please, please proceed. Take your award and sit down. I will, I will concede that your answer is, is, is much better of an answer in terms of entertainment. But I have kind of seen this behavior with my kids and I'm not the one to do it. But I've seen how Amy reacts in this situation. And as someone who teaches kids and special needs kids, uh, as much as you want to go up to the parent first, you want to like go up to the kid and your kid when they're together and tell them in like a friendly manner, Hey, we don't do that. We share this and you like do it in the kid voice. And that's how you do it without making the parent angry, but also telling the kid like, Hey, fucking knock it off. Okay. Chris, it's okay. I'm going to be right. But I think that there is a tactic that is available to you exclusively in terms of the people on this podcast, Chris, that you, you know, really need to keep in your back pocket. If you're as heated up about this, you know, as it sounds like you got, I think you need to play the race card and you cues a little. But what raises the little girl doesn't matter. No, it kind of does. It. I mean, Chris, I'll tell you, Caitlin's advice, Caitlin's advice is great advice if you want the guy to think you're a fucking pussy. Do I disagree? Oh, great disagree. I think I think that I agree. My wife is better at it than I am, but that is the most effective way to do it. If the other parent is not going to engage at all, then the only way it's for you to really handle it. And it's being a dope be a parent. Yeah. Yeah. Is to get in there and, you know, well, if you're not going to handle this shit, I am pretty much. I'm going to get in there now. You have to parent to try it to children because I'll guarantee you this fucking Michael Bean look and mother fucker at the kid park. He's an actor and right now he's failing as acting as a father. I didn't say the name. Yeah. So these kids are just just playing about and the dad's over on his phone playing with his Yamakar guitar. And yeah, you're right. Look, Jenny was there too. And so I had somebody to talk to and really call this girl names under my breath. And she agreed 1,000 percent. I mean, this is it was pretty appalling how this girl was acting. So it was nice to have that validation at least. But I'll try the Sing Songy double just the louder kind of as if I'm a teacher. You don't even before you even get to that point because I've been at the park with my kids when I mean, it doesn't they don't think I've been getting bullied like as bad as that sounds. But if I don't really not really vibe in the way the other kids are playing with her, like I'll go over there and like stand there. Like I'll just make my presence known that like this is my kid and I'm going to watch him and say and they can kind of feel it. They can kind of sense all right. I'm going to maybe back off a little bit. The better you grow when they get to close. It's really weird. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you start peeing on the swings. Smart. Yeah. Let's toss and stuff. I mean, like you got a market territory show your. The all factory system is not as advanced as canines or felines. So when we pee on swings and slides, other kids don't usually get the point until they've actually sat in the pee. No, did yeah, and can confirm as well. All right, Kale. I mean, that'll be a shit. I did. Oh God. Oh boy. Or but what did I do? What did I do? All right. Well, did I pee or did I sit in it? We know you did both. That'll be a shit. I did as a kid. We all know you did. Come on up. Get the Patreon baby. Get the Patreon. All right. Well, thanks for your advice. I think I'm going to just because Kale and has had some recent interactions that are similar to this. I tried to heat his advice most and make my presence known. Exactly. That's right. That's right. All right. Well, Kale and said what he said, I was done. I just sat down. All right. Well, speaking of our kids, too, I know Gary, you took Gary Jr. for the experience of a lifetime. Well, it's going to be multiple of these experiences because this is you basically be gun a. Yeah. I opened Pandora's Box and I took my son for the first time to Benihana. So before the mic seated up, Gary was teasing us like guys, I did something with my son. He's never done it before. I want to talk about it. And yeah, and everybody already knew it was Benihana. I don't guess it right away. I really wanted. I wish we had that on recorded because it was pretty incredible stuff. But this is after the Oscars. It was actually during the Oscars. We, you know, I think the best time to get a seat at Benihana, right? I thought I'd be honest with you, doesn't it was pretty late. It's not. It was pretty lit. It was. It was the first time that I've ever, that I can remember going to Benihana and there were empty seats at the table. Right. There was my three people and then there was another three person family and then there were two empty seats in between us. And I don't think I've ever done that before. Like I have many stories of extended wait times at Benihana, even with reservations, when they're waiting for the right combination to make sure they can fill that whole table. So this was this was a first for me. But yeah, I, we took him. He loved it. He was not a fan of the 20 or 30 minute wait where you get the soup and you get the salad and there is no show and he called me a liar because there was, because he says there's no show and they don't cook in front of you and they just brought you that soup and salad and that's definitely not how you sold this. He must have felt so betrayed like he was probably here to eat salad. He was pissed. He literally called me a liar. You know what to do in that, in that situation is you bully him like that little girl would bully Chris's kid. Yeah, I call them a racist. Yeah, I don't think he was. Smart. Smart. But, you know, we did try to sort of prepare him for this because it's, you know, it's an unconventional experience. It's not until you've been, you know, for us, it's old hat. We've all done this a million times. You know what the experience is like, but I tried to sort of prepare him for it and it was a combination of like, you know, it's a little different and a little bit of, you know, trying to hype him up and sell him and, you know, what's the big selling point that you're, you're going to sell a five year old on anyone. They grow food or the onion volcano, right? Exactly right. I mean, I'm volcano. Yeah, I mean volcano. And eventually out came our chef. He introduces himself. He starts doing the thing. He's cooking. He's throwing the rice on there. He's yada yada. And my wife announces that she's going to the bathroom and he announces he wants to go with her and he missed the volcano. Oh, no. And I don't think he, I videotaped it, which was a little uncomfortable, I think, for the other group at my table because it's sort of impossible to not have them in the shot. I tried my best, but I had to get this video because if he came back and accused me of being a liar once again about the volcano, I needed to have video evidence. I was not going to call him a racist. So you took a video of the table next to you. Interesting. My table, Matt, and it was for a five year old, just like anyone filming at a restaurant should be doing it for now. I got to say, I know I'm not to question your, your parent habits or your, you know, what you tried to do. That parent had a bridge out there. But I think you could have leaned into what I would have done in the situation, which is as soon as your wife and kid get up, you got to lean into the chef and go, can you like, wait a minute till you do the onion volcano show? Just wait till they get back, please. Just like that. No, just like that. Wait, Matt, so are you saying that you're going to ask the people at the restaurant to wait a little bit before serving your food? That's right. That's what I'm saying. Liberately inconvenience, the chef and the other diners just out of selfishness for your five year old. I, Matt, I know that I have no questions, no follow ups under no circumstances. Would that have ever crossed my mind? I don't understand why not. What's the difference? I can't back you up on this one. Or have them do it again. All right, they're back now. Do you do the thing? Would you do that, Matt, if you went to Benny Hanna and you're like, I don't want, I don't want any of those onions hitting the grill until I'm done with my miso soup. That, dude. Yeah. And if you can't do that, if you can't do that, I want to see Benny. Yeah. I got some things to say to Benny. Benny Hanna, I don't want to be a nightmare for you, Matt. Make that food and just serve it when they choose. And you're normally just filled with everything on the plate by the end of it. Like, you can't pass enough to keep up with how quickly they serve the food at Benny Hanna. You know how, or how Chris spent 20 minutes, the beginning of this podcast, explain his origin story of how his trauma began. You've just summed it up right there, my friend. So many days at Benny Hanna, just food coming and coming and coming. It's so much just pacing out. The house of horrors for Matt. Yeah. Next time, Gary, you got to undersell everything, dude. You got to aim low all the time. Get your cousin. And then everything is like holy shit, dude. When dad's around fucking magic happens. Well, I just be like, hey, let's get some dinner. And then the guy makes a fucking volcano and you're like, what do you think? The first time we took him, you don't mention the volcano. You don't mention the heart. You don't even mention the fun egg trick. You just go, they make the food in front of you. And that's it. And you let him be surprised by the rest. And if the show's not good, the harm done. I'll be on everything. I did the only thing that I told you. Especially and almost exclusively undersell Benny Hanna. Well, it didn't really matter because at the end of it, he told me that the experience was a 100 out of 10. So you're by best with Benny Hanna. And I'm very asked for you. Father of the year. What's that? I said, did you ask for your apology then? I don't know why I got it. I lied. He's young. I know what are you going to do. They, a two story Benny Hanna opening very close to my house in the very near future. So I'm very excited that he liked it because I know we will be going back. And I will tell you that the experience as a Benny Hanna, which sounds like it was a fun, delightful evening for you and your family with one child is much different when you have two children. Oh, I can imagine the amount of chaos that ensues between four people, two parents, two kids, the soups, the salads, all the food that it's nonstop shuffling of plates, it's nonstop scooping for it's nonstop things getting dropped on the floor. It is chaos. It is not. It sounds to me when you get to that level. It sounds to me like a short form documentary chaos at Benny Hanna. I want to see that. I will watch that and I will narrate that for free. Make it. Listen Netflix. Let's do it. Yeah. I need to get a fucking camera crew out of Benny Hanna. Stopped. Encourage Matt to film more rush. That your end, dude. We're doing this. Let's do it. All right. Well, anyway, I'm glad that Gary Jr. had such a good time and I mean, you're going to get that second story. Ben, you're going top floor, right? First time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I request the supper floor, please. What does it matter? What do you mean? What does it matter? What have you ever had Benny Hanna up to the air? Thank you. You got to go. I'm going to go. It's like a bunk bed. If you get a bunk bed, you're going to request bottom bunk every time. No, the reason you want a bunk bed is so you can feel, see what it's like to get that top bunk until you get old and wild experience. Until you get old enough. Until you get old enough. Yeah. Then at one point you get old enough and be like, you know what, dude, I'm not climbing to bed. I'm falling into bed and you make somebody else take it. Okay, and there's a reason that every downtown has a restaurant that's on the rooftop floor of a skyscraper. I mean, you got to eat it out. That doesn't. You got to eat it out, dude. No, I'm not here. I'm here. You get altitude, baby. The way to go. It's called altitude food. It's called altitude food. It's called altitude food. That's it. That's it. That's it. I hereby award you. If anyone said on a podcast award, I mean, if anyone ever asks what this podcast is about, just say it's a bunch of dudes like shortening things into words. Yeah, just awarding things to each other. We need a breathing. I dig it. I dig it. I'm just knees. Yeah. Oh, all right. Let's do a couple of comments before you get out of here. Do you guys down? What's happening? We're doing climates. There we go. Let's see some climates real quick. All right, these are all climates delivered to us by you, the listeners. Yes. There are a couple of ways to give us climates where we can read and react to your musings as well. First off, it's joining our Patreon. It's five bucks a month minimum. You get an extra episode a week along with, add free episodes and opportunities for meetups and movie clubs and things like that. We talked about earlier. So please, you know, extra episode is recorded pretty much consecutively with like a 10 minute P break. And I'm only on, I'm only on three beers. I got said he's getting there. I'm only on three boards. I'm an early, I'm an early slur. Awesome. Whatever gets a three clause in right now. But uh, where this is good, this next show is going to be fucking great, dude. It's literally for this show. That's literally at this rate. We'll be recording Patreon in 15 minutes. You can hear what Dawson sounds like on seven beers. Um, by the end, because I only have seven. Oh, okay. So yeah, let's, let's race ration them. Now, another way to leave comments is by joining our Facebook group. And that is free. And it's a wonderful community. We started this few years back and it's always growing, which we love. All you have to do is go to Facebook.com slash groups slash bobo boy army worldwide. LLC, they need to have a few questions. We might let you in. Very easy. And my favorite place on the net. So let's do a quick, uh, climate from the Facebook group. This is Jacob Morales. He just, he says, I have a weird question. And he put, um, he says, my friend put hot sauce on his mashed potatoes. What say you guys? And um, the joy, I don't hate it. I'm not, I'm okay with this. Yeah. I don't hate it. Hot sauce can go on everything and anything. Hot sauce is only good for meat dishes or hot sauce is an apology for poorly made dishes. Okay. The second two are insanity. Whoa. Yeah. It's a wide gap. See, and that's, that's the reason why I voted for hot sauce can go on anything. But if one of the choices was, are you, are you a psychopath? I would have chosen, are you a psychopath? Yeah. You never, in my life, will I put, unless, like, if you ever had a mashed potato taco, you, they're good and Mexico, you get a carrot taco and you get a, you know, stay at, at somebody's non as house. But I was vegan potato tacos, carrot tacos and potato tacos are the fucking thing. But a lot of Christ. Um, that sounds like there's a lot of that's the only, that's the only way you're allowed to put hot sauce on mashed potatoes. It's gravy, butter or, and either or nothing else I have spoken. This poll is missing at least one has, has the ruler of the lands. How to, as the Reven of Castle crust. This poll is, at least one and probably two options between the first one and the last two because the, the last two are just utter and sandy hot sauce is home for meat. What about it? Yeah. Hot sauces for anything you want to put it on. To basket. And that was the only logical answer. So yeah, everyone who answered otherwise is probably a psychopath as well. Well, 81% said hot sauce can go on everything or anything. And then 17% say hot sauce is an apology. And then 2% said hot sauce is only for good for meat dishes. So. I want to. The weirdest thing you guys put hot sauce on. I have an answer and I do. I run a great the meat dish. Mine is not mine. Well, mine sounds like a meat dish. It's animal style fries. And I, I put sriracha on that to Caleb's, this may, I haven't even thought of this doing this before. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. I will be trying. How do we feel about the animal style fries? I feel as though, I love the animal style fries, but I feel like the amount of spread and grilled onions they give you makes it three bites of animal style grilled fries or animal style fries followed by just french fries. All right. That's why you get extra spread. I am on working move, dude. I am on working move, dude. Kaelin, I 100% you know I'm not. And then you get extra spread packs on the side because there's no. Kaelin, come on, we live together. You know, I'm not going to live in this world where I have three bites of animal style fries and just move on. Kaelin, the way they made it. Honestly, I kind of like it because you get that top layer of animal style and then you get that bottom layer of just regular fries where you got. Yeah, but you miss the twist, man. I can still do the spread. You cover those things by the time you get them home, there's a guilla. That's why you get to get them. Yeah. And I also as a fry connoisseur, claiming it now, TM, I like to be in control when I'm eating my fries. I don't want you to decide how much sauce or whatever I'm going to have on my fries. Usually I just eat the fries with salt and I just always ask for more salt, which is well, I am now in a heart medication. But all right. Well, here's the thing. And before I make this point, let me explain to the culvers and what a burger enthusiast at their animal style fries are. They're in an out fries with. No, I know. I know. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, with melted cheese, spread and grilled onions. They're smothered. They're smothered with, yeah, and it's awesome. Now, I'll take a double, double animal style. But the fries, I respect in and out fries because there is a dude making 1750 and he's in the first part of the building you see as you pull up through the drive through. You know what that dude is? He's grabbing potatoes and he's putting them in a potato cutter and he's pulling down this large clamp and shooting the potatoes through French fry blades into a bin that then is going to be cooked and served to you. Yeah. I think it's a beautiful thing and it goes for us to serve. Yeah. I'm a hero. And I like to be in control of my fries. Well, here's the thing. That's why they offer you the animal style option, which you can do for your burgers, you can do for your fries, which they add a little extra judge and flavor and intensity to your meal. And, Doss, when you order animal style, you're not ordering the food animal style. It's because you're a fricking animal and you want them to do all that stuff to your food. Okay. You're the one that's the animal. So yeah, if you're ordering animal style fries, the fries never really thought of it. Yeah. So that's why you're just an animal like I am. Okay. I have some follow ups here because of the aforementioned sort of lack of animal contents on the fries. Are you adding more spread to this? And if so, are you doing that before you apply your suraja? I need to know how to do this correctly. Okay. This is going to be, um, look, the master. I'm not proud of a lot of things. I know I'm not proud of a lot of things I'd proud. I'm so glad I asked those questions. I need to know how to do this right. It's weird because Kaylen used to give me so much crap for putting suraja on my animal style fries. So I'm excited that he's now turned a corner. Has since forgotten his true opinion about it. I have. I have to remember this at all. All right. But more to the point, putting hot sauce on mashed potatoes is absolutely insane unless it's in a taco. Yeah. It's strange, but I'm going to try it the next time. I'm fine. Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I don't like it. I mean, I wouldn't personally do it, but if you want to do it, um, it's all good with me. It's not on my table, dude. Um, Kaylen, what you do, so what I do is I ask for an extra packet of spread, which is about one tenth of what Kaylen asked for. Is that what you call it? Spread. Yeah. What do you say to an a really sexy voice? Yeah. Can I get a, uh, that's my regular voice. I can add a extra packet of spread. And yeah, but people somehow think my voice is really sexy when I ask it. It's really weird. That's good. So I get the spread. And now what I do, Kaylen, is I take the fries that are in the box because they, they give it to you in a different kind of box. It's usually a closed box. So you open the box up and now you have two little boats of, uh, of, of where you put the fries and you have the little fry tray in the box. I take the fry tray and I turn it upside down to where now I'm just seeing dry fries at the top and the cheese, and the, and the, and the bottom. And I put the spread on that part. And then I take the suracha and I put that on top of that and then I stir it up and now each fries evenly coated with sriracha, a little extra spread, grilled unease and cheese. And each bite is better than the last and, um, I look forward to my mouth. I'm thinking about it. So yeah, I'm a freaking animal. Is the my problem with the melted cheese and the onions then just sticking to the bottom of the boat that you flipped it on to? No, if you're an amateur. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Chris probably just close the box and shake it up. A pretty smart point. I did. Yeah. I've been working live events for a long time and there's catering like basic catering. There'd be that thing at chicken cutlets or something or, you know, Philly G's Dicks or hot dogs. The only thing that was ever consistent in live event catering is the salad. Salad bar. They got all the stuff in the salad bar and you find out early on that you make a bowl of salad and you put all your stuff on it and then you get a second bowl and you top it and then you marimba shake the salad bowls. And then, but one underneath and boom, you got a tall salad, bro. Just like that. Oh, I'll tell you how to toss a salad. So, and I'll tell you in detail. So it all started with McDonald's. You just have like these salad shakers. Salad shakers. They used to give you like, it was salad and they basically gave it to you in a cup and you just put the cut, the dressing in and then you would shake it like a martini. But the thing about shaking a salad and like a salad, a closed salad case, you got to do the horizontal movement. It's all horizontal. If you go vertical when you shake, you're not going to really split it. For some reason, it's the horizontal shake that really gets you the extra coating of dressing on each side. Yeah, but there's a physics lesson. There's two directions of horizontal. You got to go side to side and then you got to go front and back. I go front. Yeah, that's right. But as long as on the horizontal axis, I'm more of a friend. You still want to go vertical. Yeah, sure. You want to go vertical because then all your dressing is going to stick to the lid and the bottom of the container. So you're working on two dimensions. You may as well explore all the territory in that. I've got vertical and I'm going to say if you really want to toss a salad right, you got to go front to back inside to side, but I wouldn't go vertical. You guys probably or anti pepper and chini in salads. Dude, I'm so pro pepper and chini and everything. All right. I put that in the next as we date. I love pepper and chini's. Yeah. It's like what you do with hot sauce. I was hoping we could add that to our water cooler crest that were pro pepper and chini. Yeah. Find me. Yeah. We're pro pepper and chini. That's pretty good, Matt. No, it wasn't. It was so much money. Yeah. You know, let's let's let's end comments there. Four years really a sweet spot for Matt's comedy, apparently. Three. All right. Well, I mean, I can't wait to see what I can't wait to see what four brings us during Patreon. So those are a comment. That was our comment. But we definitely more I'll get to them next week and thanks everybody for writing in like and and join our Facebook group. I mean, Casey Peters needs help with his break pads and for caution or has something about mystery movie Mondays that that sounds fun. And you know, Kathy Lair is going to Italy and she has a funny meme about about a dog with a chef's hat. And you want to see all this during the Facebook group. And then our Patreon too. We got a lot of great stuff on there as well. Like Don Pavel just wrote a comment that's that starts off with Gary's right. And then he goes on to talk about all this other stuff. We don't we don't need to read that later. So anyway, why don't we go around the horn. Get our plugs in and then we'll go ahead and start on Dawson's fourth beer. So I'll start in Austin, Texas, Matt fondleur. What do you suggest we check out or the dottings checks out? Well, you should definitely check out our Patreon Patreon.com slash water cooler. You get the second half of tonight's episode. And the ad free I got to say is a really, really good option to select. And I'll also just say the movie Wayne's world. I just rewatched that again. Goddamn that is just a fucking stone cold classic. So good. That's that that's the other thing I want to play. How did Wayne's world get back into your life just now? Um, I am oftentimes trying to find like a stupid comedy to watch on a Friday night. And they just don't make those kind of movies anymore. It's very hard to find a great modern comedy. So we've been dipping back to the the older classics. We also recently watched the naked gun, which I had not seen in a very long time. Again, just wall to wall. I'm going to go per minute in that movie. Unbelievable, unbelievable. I love it. I love that you're doing that too. I look to those kind of movies for comfort myself. So yeah, I recommend everybody do that. All right. Kaelin, what do you suggest people check out? Go check out just fooling about podcast. That's me and my dad's podcast. There's a great new episode out today with the director, Adam Wingard, who did the Godzilla versus King Kong movies. He did your next, which is a very fun kind of horror movie. And he has a great Gonzo action horror movie coming out later this year produced by a 24 called on slot. And my dad get into detail about the two of them working on that movie together. And it's great. It's great interview. It's super fun. Go check it out. Watch it on YouTube. Listen on Spotify. Subscribe wherever. Just fooling about. Yeah, please go. It goes in that pod and it's poor Kaelin. All right. Gary, what are you? Go check out Don Powell in our Facebook group. He sounds like he's got some really good ideas. So I would go read all of his comments. And also you can follow a reasonable doubt on YouTube, youtube.com slash reasonable doubt podcast or subscribe anywhere you get podcasts. Me and Mark, Mark keeps promising mid weeks. I have absolutely no controls. Don't at me. But a reasonable doubt podcast on YouTube. And it's patron should check out Don Powell. Oh, yeah, patron that too. Really great opinions there. I think is what Gary was trying to say to you. He lives some really nice stuff on patron as well. All right. And no, yeah, don't act Gary. Toss, what about you? Friend and I I'm doing a comedy show at the ice house. Renegades with Lynn Sun. We get after that. I'm going to be with Adam and Phoenix, stage time, TBD, but desert ridge improv, 14, 15th and 16th. All at least be there selling merch. And that'll be where you can get the the stickers and me smoking a cigarette. And it just says dude. Class image. Yeah. All right. Get a dog for four for 20. I'll make it better. I was going to say that four for 20 was really. Yeah. And also I just want to thank everyone who reached out and everyone did. And thank you. And I appreciate it. And in one day, I'll respond to all of you. It's just not going to be today. Oh, good. And yeah, we got good. I missed today. Actually, think about it. I guess. Yeah. We got the way you just said you just responded all of them at once. So it's kind of the easiest way to do that. Yeah, but it's putting it on them. They got to listen to the podcast. Now I got to search out. Yeah. How about this? And instead of thanking everybody personally, just send them the link to this show. You know, one of the things that's more like. Just put a time. And just put a time. God. Yeah. That's pretty good. I'll. Wow. I might actually listen to the show for the first time ever. I mean, you're going to skip to the end of the number of wine. I mean, you got to listen through and hear altitude. I mean, come on. That's fucking gold. Don't give them a time. God, have them earn it. Also, also about. I'm going to say three years ago. Do you guys ever eat the Vinny Tortoritch, Ulter fat? I tried it back in the day. You tried it all in butter or whatever. Yeah. Well, I got an old one somewhere. I couldn't find an old one, but I have a recurring delivery of these. And to be honest, what I've eaten today, and this is probably why the alcohol has affected me so fast, I've eaten four of five of Vinny. The Tortoritch is Ulter fat energy. So you get some fucking protein, a broccoli shake. And because I just don't eat unless I feel inspired to cook, you know what I mean? So Vinny Tortoritch's stuff gets me through the day. I just work. I told Vinny in an email about three years ago. Hey, bro. The packaging of these things hits the corners of your mouth and like, you can't, you're in danger of cutting your lips when you eat these. The next time you manufacture these things, please consider making a smaller opening so that you can get your mouth around it. I got my recurring. I got my recurring and hung up the phone. I got my recurring delivery from Vinny Tortoritch today. And this is the new packaging. Oh, she that's the ultra fat Mark two baby. He did it. Nice. These now I'm no longer in danger of cutting my mouth wide open when I eat one of these things. And if you do it wrong, you could. I mean, you got to be really special to make it happen, but it is possible. Yeah. To be clear, you're not supposed to eat the wrapper, right? No, dude. It's it's it's it's it's a mixture of like edible wrapping. You know, you know, you know, you buy peanut butter and the oil sits at the top. I would get totally do it. You know, you buy peanut butter and the oil sits at the top, the, the good kind of peanut butter that you got are really blend. Oh, yeah. So these things, these things do separate. So you just mix them up and essentially you're eating peanut butter, but it's from awesome nuts, not garbage nuts. It's all men's it's all men butter. Yeah. It's good stuff. It's very, it's very good. I have a few of them in my pantry as well. And now you want to throw them out knowing that there's a smaller whole version. So my last plug is for C minus. Here's the number four. Thanks guys. I had to make up because I listened to the shows like eight times. I get it. I didn't get any plugs. You got to catch up. And if you mathematically times, all the times I heard your guys's plugs kind of feel like a mode a few more this time. So thank you. No, it's good. It's good to make it right. And then ask for me. Please peel your bananas before freezing them. All right, that'll do for this episode of WaterClor. Thank you so much for hanging out with us. We back for Patreon later this week. We love you. Goodbye.
